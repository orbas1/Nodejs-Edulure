# Edulure Platform – Pre-launch Valuation Assessment (May 2025)

## Summary valuation
- **Estimated pre-launch equity value (midpoint): £0.9M**
- **Valuation range:** £0.65M – £1.10M
- **Valuation date:** 2025-05-20

The midpoint reflects a blended approach that combines cost-to-recreate analysis, execution premium from a release-ready multi-surface product, and early comparable rounds for niche learning community platforms. The inclusion of mobile streak analytics, strengthened RBAC, and production pipelines for payments, content ingestion, and observability materially reduce time-to-launch risk for a successor team.【F:update_template/upload_brief.md†L3-L44】【F:update_template/user_phone_app_updates/build_updates.md†L3-L28】

## Cost-based triangulation under a solo-builder + AI scenario
1. **Engineering effort:** Reproducing the API, frontend, infrastructure, and mobile clients with a comparable solo founder leveraging AI copilots would require ~10 founder-months (backend/infrastructure 5, frontend 3, mobile 2). Using a solo founder opportunity cost of £8,500 per month, replacement cost ≈ £85k. Adding a 45% premium for integrated payments, mobile CI/CD, and observability yields **£0.12M**.
2. **Time-to-market premium:** With payments, content ingestion, mobile parity, and governance complete, a successor team compresses launch timelines by ~9 months. Applying a 0.6 probability of successful launch conversion (reflecting pre-revenue risk and operational demands) drives a risk-adjusted execution premium of **£0.40M**.
3. **Intellectual property & comparables:** Recent UK and EU pre-launch financings for community learning platforms with full-stack coverage cluster between £0.6M and £1.3M post-money. Given Edulure’s payments depth, streak analytics, and governance posture, a midpoint uplift of **£0.38M** is defensible even for a single-builder origin story.

Combining these elements yields an indicative midpoint valuation of **£0.90M**, with sensitivity bands of £0.65M–£1.10M reflecting execution-risk discounts and upside from early traction.

## Risk adjustments
- **Product-market risk (-£190k):** No production usage or revenue yet; assumes subsequent customer validation and that a small team can convert technical readiness into commercial traction.
- **Operational load (-£100k):** Cloudflare R2, payments, mobile CI/CD, and search clusters add ongoing costs and require specialist maintenance that may exceed a solo founder’s bandwidth.
- **Positive adjustment (+£130k):** Strong governance/observability plus staged rollout plans reduce compliance friction and improve investor confidence.【F:update_template/upload_brief.md†L22-L62】【F:update_template/user_phone_app_updates/build_updates.md†L13-L33】

## Recommendations
1. **Validate early design partners** to justify the upper end of the valuation range and demonstrate conversion for payments and streak analytics.
2. **Document infrastructure-as-code** for R2, Meilisearch, and mobile CI pipelines to reinforce operational readiness during diligence.
3. **Produce financial models** translating community engagement metrics, streak retention, and premium subscriptions into revenue projections.
4. **Establish post-launch KPI cadence** (DAU, streak recovery rate, churn) aligning investor updates with the telemetry available across web and mobile clients.

## KPI scoreboard linkage (Q3 FY25)
`npm run generate:strategy-brief` exports the live KPI table into `valuation/generated-scorecard.md`, keeping valuation inputs aligned with stakeholder reporting. The same metrics are seeded into `navigation_annex_strategy_narratives`/`navigation_annex_strategy_metrics`, ensuring `/api/v1/navigation/annex` surfaces identical baselines and targets for ops and design stakeholders. Key links:

- **Activation** — Conversion uplift targets (20% trial → paid, 75% onboarding completion) validate the growth premium baked into the midpoint valuation.
- **Retention** — Streak health, live attendance, and NPS goals protect recurring revenue assumptions and justify the execution premium.
- **Efficiency** — Support minutes per ticket, upload readiness, and ARPU improvements map directly to the cost-based triangulation and margin sensitivities described above.

Embed the generated table in diligence packets or board materials to show how valuation drivers correspond to real telemetry and accountable owners.
