# Error Scan Report

The backend (`backend-nodejs`) and frontend (`frontend-reactjs`) packages were scanned by running their lint and test commands. The outputs below capture every error encountered.

## Backend Errors
- `npm run lint` fails because ESLint cannot resolve the `globals` package referenced from `eslint.config.js`. The run aborts with `Error [ERR_MODULE_NOT_FOUND]: Cannot find package 'globals' imported from /workspace/Nodejs-Edulure/backend-nodejs/eslint.config.js`.
- `npm test` fails immediately: the `vitest` binary is not found on the PATH when running `vitest run`, causing the script to exit with code 127.

## Frontend Errors
- `npm run lint` reports three parsing errors:
  1. `/src/components/routing/ProtectedRoute.jsx` line 81 – `Parsing error: Identifier 'hasAccess' has already been declared`.
  2. `/src/layouts/DashboardLayout.jsx` line 27 – `Parsing error: Unexpected token Bars3Icon`.
  3. `/src/layouts/MainLayout.jsx` line 56 – `Parsing error: Unexpected token {`.

## Tasks
1. Restore the missing `globals` dependency (or adjust the ESLint config) so `npm run lint` succeeds in `backend-nodejs`.
2. Ensure `vitest` is installed or invoked correctly so `npm test` succeeds in `backend-nodejs`.
3. Resolve the duplicate `hasAccess` declaration in `frontend-reactjs/src/components/routing/ProtectedRoute.jsx` and re-run `npm run lint`.
4. Fix the syntax issues in `frontend-reactjs/src/layouts/DashboardLayout.jsx` and `frontend-reactjs/src/layouts/MainLayout.jsx`, then re-run `npm run lint`.
