# Operations handbook

The operations handbook curates the runbooks referenced throughout the admin console. Each guide focuses on the
lightweight processes a single operator can run while maintaining reliability across revenue, compliance, and
integrations.

## Available guides

- [Incident escalation runbook](incident-escalation.md)
- [Revenue reconciliation checklist](revenue-reconciliation.md)
- [Integrations hub guide](integrations-hub.md)

## How to use this handbook

1. **Start from the admin console.** Each saved view and helper text links directly to a relevant handbook entry so
   operators can jump from telemetry to action.
2. **Follow the checklists.** Every guide is designed as a short series of checks and scripts that can be completed in
   a few minutes without additional tooling.
3. **Record the outcome.** After executing a runbook, capture the result inside the admin console (approvals, notes, or
   exported reports) so the rest of the team can see the audit trail.

These guides will expand as more surfaces graduate from the user experience roadmap. Contributions are welcomeâ€”update the
markdown files in this directory and mention the change in the release notes.
