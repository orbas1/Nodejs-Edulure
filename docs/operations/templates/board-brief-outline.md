# Board briefing outline

1. **Opening metrics snapshot**  
   - Use the KPI scorecard generated by `npm run generate:strategy-brief` (`valuation/generated-scorecard.md`).  
   - Highlight deltas versus prior board meeting.
2. **Strategic narrative**  
   - Summarise pillar narratives from `docs/operations/strategy.md` emphasising progress and blockers.  
   - Attach latest Annex evidence (design, operations, valuation).
3. **Financial runway & valuation**  
   - Reference updated assumptions in `valuation/edulure-prelaunch-valuation.md`.  
   - Flag variances in ARPU, churn, or CAC.
4. **Risks & mitigations**  
   - List top three risks by probability/impact.  
   - Map each risk to owner, mitigation plan, and required approvals.
5. **Decisions required**  
   - Enumerate budget, hiring, or roadmap approvals requested from the board.  
   - Provide annex links or data rooms for deeper review.
6. **Next steps & follow-ups**  
   - Confirm action owners, due dates, and reporting cadence.
