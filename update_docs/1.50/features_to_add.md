# Version 1.50 â€“ Features to Add

## Web Application
### 1. Enterprise Platform Upgrade
- **Infrastructure hardening**: implement audit logging microservice, WAF configuration, rate limiting middleware, and automated backup jobs.
- **Environment cleanup**: refactor configuration loader to default safe values for non-sensitive settings (e.g., pagination limits, feature flags) while reducing `.env` to critical secrets; publish `.env.example` with mandatory keys only.
- **Security remediations**: encrypt sensitive columns (PII, financial data) via KMS, replace plaintext credentials, enable antivirus scanning service, and roll out phishing/scam warning banner service across UI.
- **Compliance tooling**: add GDPR consent ledger table and data subject request workflow with admin approval queue.
- **Observability & readiness**: create uptime dashboards, log correlation IDs, health-check endpoints, and runbook repository covering incident response, rollback, and communication procedures.
