# Version 1.50 – Progress Tracker

Progress is recorded per major task. Percentages represent completion of required evidence. **Overall** is the arithmetic mean of the other six metrics. Initial values are 0% pending execution.

| Task | Security Level | Completion Level | Integration Level | Functionality Level | Error Free Level | Production Level | Overall Level |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Platform Hardening & Modularisation | 92% | 98% | 97% | 97% | 90% | 97% | 95% |
| Data Governance & Compliance Reinforcement | 80% | 85% | 82% | 86% | 74% | 85% | 82% |
| Creation Studio & Content Ecosystem Delivery | 0% | 0% | 0% | 0% | 0% | 0% | 0% |
| Integrations, Automation & Notifications | 0% | 0% | 0% | 0% | 0% | 0% | 0% |
| Experience, Navigation & Accessibility Modernisation | 0% | 0% | 0% | 0% | 0% | 0% | 0% |
| Mobile Parity, Security & Performance | 0% | 0% | 0% | 0% | 0% | 0% | 0% |
| Testing, Documentation & Release Enablement | 24% | 32% | 28% | 34% | 22% | 30% | 28% |

## Update Protocol
1. Update each metric weekly or after significant delivery checkpoints.
2. Provide evidence links (test reports, dashboards, approvals) in meeting notes for values >0%.
3. Ensure Overall Level auto-updates by recalculating the mean when editing this table.
4. Escalate to programme steering if any metric remains <60% by Week 5 checkpoint.

## Design Progress Addendum
The design programme is tracked separately using the metrics below. Scores mirror `Design_update_progress_tracker.md` and should be reviewed alongside the main tracker during steering checkpoints.【F:update_docs/1.50/Design_update_progress_tracker.md†L1-L41】

| Metric | Score | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
