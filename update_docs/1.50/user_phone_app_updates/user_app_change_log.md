# Flutter User App Change Log â€“ Version 1.50 Task 2

- Bootstrapped secure session storage with `SessionManager` (Hive boxes) and Dio-powered API clients configured via `api_config.dart`.
- Implemented `AuthService` to authenticate against `/api/auth/login`, persist session tokens, and surface welcome messaging.
- Added `ContentService` orchestrating asset listings, viewer tokens, offline downloads (with `open_filex`), progress updates, and analytics events.
- Delivered `ContentLibraryScreen` UI with refresh controls, download indicators, and DRM-compliant actions tied to backend limits.
