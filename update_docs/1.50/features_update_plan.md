- **Change Control:** Weekly steering committee to review progress, risks, dependency blockers, and approve scope changes.
- **Analytics & Experimentation:** Instrument feature usage, set up A/B tests (e.g., explorer ranking variants, follow suggestions), and monitor KPIs.
- **Training & Enablement:** Provide workshops/webinars for instructors, community managers, support, and sales to adopt new tooling.
- **Risk Mitigation:** Maintain risk register with owners, impact/probability scoring, and mitigation/contingency plans.
