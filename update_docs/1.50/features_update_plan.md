   - Surface follow widgets in course pages, community pages, and explorer recommendations.
2. **Profile Area Redesign**
   - Produce component inventory and design tokens shared across web/mobile.
   - Implement backend aggregators for profile stats, community badges, affiliate metrics.
   - Build new profile layout for Students and Instructors with reusable components.
   - Wire up seeders/migrations for new profile modules (achievements, follower counts, community highlights).
   - Create Flutter (or React Native) screens mirroring web experience, including API hooks and navigation routes.

## Phase 4 – Communities 2.0
1. **Core Community Platform**
   - Model community entities, roles (members/admins/moderators), tier points, and paywalls.
   - Develop post management suite (categories, comments, replies, maps, attachments, moderation queue).
   - Implement community feed aggregation with pagination, filters, and caching.
   - Add calendar, classroom modules, leaderboards, and online presence tracking.
2. **Affiliate & Monetisation Layer**
   - Extend instructor dashboard with community management (create, manage, analytics).
   - Build affiliate section on user profiles and dashboards with earnings, withdrawals, and link creation from followed communities.
   - Integrate subscription/paywall logic with payment gateway and entitlement checks.
3. **Collaboration & Communication**
   - Upgrade chat/inbox capabilities with real-time messaging, group threads, and notifications.
   - Add admin panel sections for community oversight, reports, and moderation actions.
4. **Mobile Parity**
   - Deliver mobile screens for community home, feed, posts, chat, map, calendar, leaderboards.
   - Ensure API connections, actions, and offline caching mirror web functionality.

## Phase 5 – Explorer & Search Engine
1. **Navigation & UX**
   - Add Explorer to global menu and header; update breadcrumbs and quick actions.
   - Design responsive explorer layout with cards for communities, profiles, courses, ebooks, tutors.
2. **Search Infrastructure**
   - Deploy Meilisearch cluster with replication and backups; configure synonyms and ranking rules.
   - Build ingestion pipelines to index communities, user profiles, courses, ebooks, and tutors.
   - Integrate matching engine for lightweight personalization and trending results.
3. **Front-End Integration**
   - Implement search components (filters, facets, sort, auto-complete) for web.
   - Create mobile explorer screens with infinite scroll, saved searches, and voice query hooks.
   - Connect explorer results to follower system, community invites, and PowerPoint/ebook deep links.

## Phase 6 – Quality Assurance & Launch
1. **Testing Strategy**
   - Execute unit, integration, and end-to-end tests across backend, web, and mobile for each feature module.
   - Run load tests for R2 delivery, community feeds, chat, and Meilisearch queries.
   - Perform accessibility audits (WCAG) and localisation checks.
2. **Data & Content Seeding**
   - Populate staging with sample communities, courses, ebooks, and follower networks using seeders.
   - Validate migrations for profile redesign and community schema changes.
3. **Beta & Feedback Loop**
   - Launch private beta with selected instructors/students; collect telemetry and surveys.
   - Iterate on feedback, fix defects, and polish UI/UX inconsistencies.
4. **Release Management**
   - Prepare release notes, tutorials, and support documentation for Version 1.50.
   - Enable feature flags progressively; monitor dashboards for adoption and error rates.
   - Schedule follow-up sprints for post-launch optimisation and backlog grooming.
