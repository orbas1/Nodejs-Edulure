- Implement webhook/event bus to broadcast CRM, payment, and community events to internal modules and external partners.
- Document integration playbooks including sandbox credentials, rate limits, and fallback procedures.

### Phase D – Experience & Interface (Weeks 4-5)
- Apply new design system (colours, typography, spacing) across web and mobile.
- Rework navigation menus (header/footer/dashboards) with vector icons and responsive behaviour.
- Enhance messaging/inbox UI, chat bubbles, notification centre, and onsite community feeds.
- Optimise community social graph displays (followers, memberships) and feed posting experiences.
- Finalise UX of creation studio, dashboards, and live feed interactions for usability and accessibility.
- Implement onboarding tooltips, contextual help, and knowledge base links across key flows.
- Localise core screens, policies, transactional emails, and notifications; perform language QA.
- Conduct usability sessions with target roles (admin, instructor, learner) and capture remediation items.

### Phase E – Mobile Parity (Weeks 3-5, parallel squad)
- Implement configurable API base URL with environment switcher and fallback defaults.
- Port creation outputs, financial management, messaging, live feed, notifications, and settings to mobile where appropriate.
- Optimise widget structure, screen organisation, and component performance to maintain small app size.
- Align mobile policies (About, Terms, Privacy) and integrate payment and social login flows.
- Integrate Firebase push notifications and ensure offline/online sync reliability.
- Add scam warning components, fraud reporting, and ads placement governance tailored for mobile UX.
- Ensure mobile analytics, crash reporting, and feature flagging align with web metrics for cross-platform insights.
- Create mobile-specific accessibility adjustments (dynamic text sizing, voice-over labels, contrast checks).

### Phase F – Documentation & Release (Week 5)
- Update README, setup guides, update index, change log, and test plans to reflect completed work.
- Create admin/operator runbooks for integrations, AI toggles, scam warnings, and ads management.
- Finalise `.env.example`, configuration references, and developer onboarding notes.
- Produce compliance dossiers (GDPR, privacy impact assessment, security controls) for legal sign-off.
- Prepare customer-facing release notes, marketing collateral, and training webinars.
- Schedule hypercare roster, triage procedures, and escalation policies for post-launch.

## 4. Quality Assurance & Testing Strategy

## 5. Deployment Plan
1. **Staging rollout** with feature flags enabled for new modules; run smoke tests and integration validations.
2. **User acceptance testing** with pilot instructors/admins; collect feedback on creation studio and dashboards.
3. **Production readiness review** covering monitoring dashboards, alerting, runbooks, and rollback strategy.

5. **Post-launch hypercare** for 72 hours with dedicated triage squad and daily status updates.
6. **Mobile store release coordination** ensuring Play Store/App Store assets, privacy labels, and review submissions align with launch timeline.
7. **Integration partner notifications** to inform CRM, AI, and payment vendors of go-live and new traffic patterns.

## 6. Risk Management & Mitigations
- **Integration instability** – Provide sandbox/test accounts, mock services, and circuit breakers for CRM/AI providers.
- **Scope creep** – Enforce change control via steering committee; backlog non-critical requests.
- **Security regressions** – Automate scanning in CI/CD; enforce peer reviews with security checklist.
- **Mobile performance issues** – Implement lazy loading, asset compression, and remove unused dependencies.
- **User adoption lag** – Deliver in-product onboarding tooltips, help centre updates, and marketing enablement assets.
- **Data migration failures** – Run rehearsals, maintain rollback scripts, and monitor data integrity dashboards.
- **Regulatory non-compliance** – Engage legal early, maintain evidence repository, and conduct privacy impact assessments.
- **Support overload post-launch** – Staff hypercare war room, prepare escalation matrix, and monitor support SLAs in real time.
