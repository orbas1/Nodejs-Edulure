# Version 1.50 Design Milestones

## Milestone 1 – Discovery & Alignment Complete (Target: Week 2 – Completion 45%)
- **Scope:** Conclude user interviews, validate wireframes for learner/provider journeys, and document prioritised feedback for home, explorer, communities, and settings.
- **Entry Criteria:** Application/Web wireframe sets prepared; research participants recruited; analytics baseline requirements drafted.
- **Exit Criteria:**
  - Usability findings captured with prioritised issue stack.
  - Approved navigation architecture for mobile and web shells.
  - Updated personas and journey maps reflecting Communities 2.0 and explorer flows.
  - Signed-off research readout shared with product, engineering, and support leads.
- **Risks & Mitigations:** Participant attrition (schedule backups); conflicting feedback (apply decision log).

## Milestone 2 – Cross-Platform Design System Frozen (Target: Week 4 – Completion 30%)
- **Scope:** Finalise typography, colour, spacing, elevation tokens, and base components across React and Flutter libraries; document motion and accessibility rules.
- **Dependencies:** Discovery readout, brand token updates, accessibility audits kickoff.
- **Exit Criteria:**
  - Token libraries synced across Figma files with change log.
  - Component kits (navigation, cards, form inputs, modals) documented with responsive specs.
  - Accessibility baseline (contrast ratios, focus states, text scaling) recorded.
  - Analytics instrumentation IDs defined for reusable components.
- **Risks & Mitigations:** Token drift between platforms (use shared library governance); accessibility gaps (run automated and manual audits).

## Milestone 3 – Feature Surface Detailing (Target: Week 6 – Completion 20%)
- **Scope:** Deliver high-fidelity designs and interaction specs for home dashboards, explorer, Communities 2.0 hub, media viewers, profiles, and compliance-ready settings.
- **Dependencies:** Design system freeze; updated logic flows; product requirements for Communities 2.0 monetisation and explorer filters.
- **Exit Criteria:**
  - High-fidelity screens approved for mobile and web key journeys.
  - Interaction notes, edge states, and empty states documented in design specs.
  - Microcopy guidelines reviewed with Content & Community team.
  - Feedback from engineering feasibility review resolved or tracked.
- **Risks & Mitigations:** Late scope changes (use change control board); performance concerns (engage engineers during walkthroughs).

## Milestone 4 – Design QA & Engineering Handoff (Target: Week 8 – Completion 10%)
- **Scope:** Package Zeplin/Figma exports, annotate logic maps, and run accessibility/localisation QA prior to development sprints.
- **Dependencies:** Feature surface detailing complete; QA resource availability.
- **Exit Criteria:**
  - All redlines, component specs, and interaction videos delivered to engineering.
  - Accessibility and localisation audit results signed off with remediation backlog captured.
  - Design QA checklist executed with defects triaged in Jira.
  - Handoff playbook (communication plan, review cadence) circulated to squads.
- **Risks & Mitigations:** Resource contention for QA (book capacity early); outstanding compliance questions (escalate to legal/product leadership).
