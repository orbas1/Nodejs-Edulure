# Front-end Evaluation (v1.50 Pre-Update)

## Functionality
- Routing covers marketing, auth, community feed, profile, search, and admin pages, but most pages render static mock content. There are no data-fetching hooks or mutation flows tied to the backend, so actions like "Join the Community", "Launch workspace", or "Load more updates" do not perform real operations.
- Authentication forms (Login/Register) collect fields but never submit to an API or manage form state beyond uncontrolled inputs. There is no client-side validation, progress feedback, or error display.
- Components like `FeedComposer`, `SearchBar`, and `AdminStats` present UI but do not expose events that would integrate with state managers or APIs, limiting reusability once real data is introduced.

## Usability
- Visual design is polished with Tailwind utility classes and responsive navigation, but accessibility is uneven. Some interactive elements lack `aria` attributes (`Disclosure` menu button only has screen-reader text but panel is absolutely positioned without focus trapping), and forms use placeholders without labels in some cases (e.g., select element inside `FormField`).
- Mobile navigation relies on Headless UI's `Disclosure`, yet focus management after closing the menu is not handled. Buttons such as "Join the Community" or "Launch my workspace" do not indicate loading states, reducing perceived responsiveness.
- Input components are uncontrolled; there is no auto-complete guidance, password strength hints, or inline validation errors, making onboarding error-prone.

## Errors
- Because there are no API calls, network error handling is absent. Any future integration will require adding `try/catch` logic, toast notifications, and retry UX from scratch.
- Forms do not prevent submission with empty values (`type="submit"` buttons trigger default browser POST navigation if not prevented). This can cause full page reloads under Vite dev server, leading to confusing behaviour for testers.
- Components assume presence of data (e.g., `selectedCommunity` initialised from `communities[0]` without null guard). If the data array is empty, the feed page will throw at render.

## Integration
- There is no API client abstraction. Although axios is installed, it is unused; React Query, SWR, or Redux Toolkit Query are absent. Integrating with the backend will require foundational infrastructure for requests, caching, and error states.
- The UI references features provided by external services (Meilisearch, live video, analytics) but no SDKs or placeholder connectors exist. This gap will slow down integration once those services are ready.
- Environment configuration (API base URLs, feature flags) is missing. Vite's `.env` files are not leveraged, so switching between staging and production will require code edits.

## Security
- Auth-related pages do not mask sensitive interactions beyond HTML input types. There is no CSRF protection, session handling, or secure storage strategy for tokens. Without route guards, any user can navigate directly to `/admin` or `/feed` regardless of authentication state.
- Links to privacy/terms/support in the footer are plain anchors pointing to `/privacy`, `/terms`, `/support` without routes, resulting in 404s if clicked. This erodes trust and may expose internal routing data if the server falls back to directory listings.
- External images are loaded from public CDNs without fallback or CSP guidance. If those URLs change, the UI will break silently.

## Alignment
- The front-end markets capabilities (AI-assisted search, analytics dashboards, instructor approvals) that the backend/database do not yet implement, creating a misalignment in user expectations. Update 1.50 should either scope the UI to existing functionality or accelerate API delivery.
- Component architecture is largely page-specific; there is no design system or shared state management aligning with a scalable product. Investing in a component library and data layer would align with the platform's growth narrative.
- There is no localisation or theming support despite references to global communities. Aligning with product strategy requires internationalisation planning and accessibility conformance.
