# Front-end Evaluation – Version 1.50

## Functionality
- **Single bundle drives every persona.** `App.jsx` mounts marketing, learner dashboard, instructor tooling, community management, analytics, ads, and services routes in one router tree guarded only by `ProtectedRoute`. Without code-splitting or feature-based bundles, the client ships the entire application to every visitor, degrading load performance and complicating enterprise rollout sequencing.【F:frontend-reactjs/src/App.jsx†L1-L160】
- **Provider nesting couples startup to every service.** `main.jsx` wraps the root in language, auth, runtime config, realtime, and dashboard providers without suspense boundaries. A failure in any provider (e.g., realtime handshake) blocks initial render and leads to blank screens during outages.【F:frontend-reactjs/src/main.jsx†L1-L27】
- **HTTP client centralises caching but lacks offline resilience.** The Axios wrapper normalises headers, caches GET responses, and invalidates tags; however, there is no background refresh, offline queueing, or stale-while-revalidate strategy for dashboards, so analytics data becomes stale quickly in enterprise scenarios.【F:frontend-reactjs/src/api/httpClient.js†L1-L153】
- **Runtime configuration is synchronous.** The runtime provider immediately requests feature flag snapshots on mount, and failures default to empty objects without granular fallbacks. Feature-gated components cannot distinguish between “disabled” and “failed to load,” complicating staged rollouts.【F:frontend-reactjs/src/context/RuntimeConfigContext.jsx†L26-L97】
- **Dashboard layout hardcodes navigation for every persona.** `DashboardLayout.jsx` renders large static navigation arrays and search indices for learner, instructor, community, and admin roles in one component. Adding or removing modules requires editing the layout file directly, increasing regression risk and preventing tenant-specific bundles.【F:frontend-reactjs/src/layouts/DashboardLayout.jsx†L1-L160】

## Usability
- **Session lifecycle gaps frustrate users.** Auth context persists tokens in `localStorage` and surfaces `isLoading`/`error`, but there is no proactive token refresh or UX message when sessions expire; protected routes simply redirect to login, causing data loss mid-flow.【F:frontend-reactjs/src/context/AuthContext.jsx†L16-L88】【F:frontend-reactjs/src/components/routing/ProtectedRoute.jsx†L40-L69】
- **Role-based access is opaque.** `ProtectedRoute` derives roles from session and dashboard context but redirects unauthorised users to `/` without explanation or read-only fallbacks. Enterprise admins will need contextual denial messaging and audit logs for access reviews.【F:frontend-reactjs/src/components/routing/ProtectedRoute.jsx†L7-L69】
- **Design system lacks tokens and accessibility hooks.** Pages rely on dense Tailwind utility classes via `styles.css`, yet there are no central design tokens or high-contrast themes. Updating typography or accommodating WCAG contrast ratios requires editing dozens of components manually.【F:frontend-reactjs/src/styles.css†L1-L200】
- **Localization coverage is inconsistent.** The language provider offers locale switching, but translation dictionaries primarily cover navigation strings; deep dashboard pages embed English copy, undermining the promise of multi-language support for enterprise deployments.【F:frontend-reactjs/src/context/LanguageContext.jsx†L1-L120】【F:frontend-reactjs/src/pages/dashboard/DashboardHome.jsx†L1-L60】
- **Navigation overload hampers discovery.** Dashboard sidebars expose more than twenty options per persona with minimal grouping. Without adaptive menus or progressive disclosure, enterprise learners face cognitive overload and require bespoke training.【F:frontend-reactjs/src/layouts/DashboardLayout.jsx†L1-L160】

## Errors
- **Error handling collapses context.** Axios interceptors wrap responses into generic `Error` objects with message/status but drop request metadata; downstream UI components therefore display identical toasts for timeouts, validation failures, and auth issues, slowing support triage.【F:frontend-reactjs/src/api/httpClient.js†L15-L131】
- **No global error boundary or suspense fallback.** React StrictMode is used, but there is no error boundary to capture rendering failures. A broken widget can blank the entire dashboard instead of isolating the failure and presenting a recovery path.【F:frontend-reactjs/src/main.jsx†L1-L27】
- **Provider failures are silent.** RuntimeConfig and Realtime providers swallow errors into context state; components render with default values and no banner, leading operators to believe features are disabled when underlying services are simply unavailable.【F:frontend-reactjs/src/context/RuntimeConfigContext.jsx†L26-L97】
- **Form and validation errors lack structure.** There is no shared form library or error pattern; each page handles errors ad hoc, increasing the chance of inconsistent messaging and missing accessibility attributes, especially in complex dashboards such as instructor course creation.【F:frontend-reactjs/src/pages/dashboard/InstructorCourseCreate.jsx†L1-L200】
- **Realtime disconnections are invisible.** The socket provider does not expose connectivity state, so instructors do not know when live classrooms lose realtime updates until interactions fail silently.【F:frontend-reactjs/src/main.jsx†L9-L23】

## Integration
- **Environment management is manual.** The HTTP client defaults to `http://localhost:4000/api` and expects `VITE_API_URL` for other environments. There is no multi-env build pipeline or runtime configuration for staging/prod URLs, forcing teams to juggle `.env` files per deploy.【F:frontend-reactjs/src/api/httpClient.js†L5-L13】
- **Realtime resilience is underdeveloped.** The app loads `socket.io-client` but lacks reconnection handlers, presence indicators, or admin tooling to monitor connection health. Enterprises expect clear status and retry logic for collaboration features.【F:frontend-reactjs/package.json†L18-L33】【F:frontend-reactjs/src/main.jsx†L9-L23】
- **Runtime configuration contract is ambiguous.** The provider fetches `/runtime/snapshot` for admins and `/runtime/user` for authenticated users without schema validation or caching. A backend schema change can break client assumptions silently, as there is no TypeScript or Zod schema enforcement in the frontend.【F:frontend-reactjs/src/context/RuntimeConfigContext.jsx†L26-L97】
- **Analytics dependencies lack backend parity.** Recharts/D3 visualisations assume data availability, but there is no feature flag gating around analytics routes. If backend analytics APIs lag behind, the UI renders empty charts with no messaging.【F:frontend-reactjs/src/App.jsx†L80-L148】【F:frontend-reactjs/package.json†L18-L32】
- **Shared contexts are tightly coupled to REST payloads.** Dashboard context expects specific JSON shapes for `profile`, `roles`, and `dashboards`. Without generated types or versioning, integration changes require coordinated releases across all clients.【F:frontend-reactjs/src/context/DashboardContext.jsx†L1-L160】

## Security
- **Token storage vulnerable to XSS.** Access and refresh tokens live in `localStorage` without `HttpOnly` protections; any XSS vulnerability exposes credentials. There is no optional cookie-based strategy for higher-assurance environments.【F:frontend-reactjs/src/context/AuthContext.jsx†L16-L83】
- **Client-side authorization only.** Role checks happen in the browser, and protected routes redirect unauthorised users but do not mask API calls. Without server-side enforcement, determined attackers can call backend APIs directly regardless of UI gating.【F:frontend-reactjs/src/components/routing/ProtectedRoute.jsx†L40-L69】
- **Security headers depend on hosting configuration.** Vite’s default build emits static assets without CSP, HSTS, or frame options. Unless deployed behind the Node backend with Helmet, standalone hosting leaves content exposed to framing and script injection.【F:frontend-reactjs/package.json†L10-L17】【F:frontend-reactjs/src/main.jsx†L1-L27】
- **Runtime config exposes feature metadata.** Admin snapshots include feature flags and config values that may reveal upcoming launches. There is no redaction layer or caching strategy to prevent enumeration by compromised admin sessions.【F:frontend-reactjs/src/context/RuntimeConfigContext.jsx†L26-L97】
- **Third-party analytics and fonts lack consent gating.** Fonts and charting libraries initialise immediately without cookie consent flows, creating compliance risk in regions requiring explicit user approval.【F:frontend-reactjs/src/main.jsx†L1-L27】【F:frontend-reactjs/package.json†L18-L48】

## Alignment
- **Experience vision exceeds current UX maturity.** The app aspires to deliver realtime communities, analytics, and instructor monetisation, yet foundational UX elements (session renewal, localisation, accessibility) are under-developed, conflicting with Version 1.50’s enterprise-ready positioning.【F:frontend-reactjs/src/App.jsx†L1-L160】【F:frontend-reactjs/src/context/AuthContext.jsx†L39-L88】
- **Operational tooling is missing.** There is no feature flag dashboard, health indicator, or audit log within the UI, so operators cannot manage platform state without direct backend access, contradicting the promise of self-serve administration.【F:frontend-reactjs/src/context/RuntimeConfigContext.jsx†L26-L97】
- **Navigation scale clashes with tenant customisation goals.** Because navigation is hardcoded in a single file, delivering tenant-specific experiences requires branching the codebase rather than configuring features, undermining the “enterprise configurability” narrative for 1.50.【F:frontend-reactjs/src/layouts/DashboardLayout.jsx†L1-L160】
- **Recommended focus for the update.** Implement route-based code splitting, introduce error boundaries and connectivity banners, migrate tokens to secure storage or cookies, generate typed API contracts, and invest in localisation plus accessibility audits to align the frontend with enterprise expectations for 1.50.
