# Issue List (v1.50 Pre-Update)

1. Backend APIs lack coverage for core product domains, consistent response contracts, validation, and hardened security.
2. Dependency strategy is incomplete, with unused packages, missing client infrastructure, absent audits, and no environment governance.
3. Database schema, migration process, and operational controls are insufficient for the advertised roadmap and compliance needs.
4. React front-end relies on static mocks, missing validation, accessibility, and integration layers required for production use.
5. Flutter user app is placeholder-only, lacking networking, state management, persistence, and security safeguards.
