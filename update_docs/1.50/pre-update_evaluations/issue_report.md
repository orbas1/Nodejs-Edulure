# v1.50 Pre-Update Issue Report

## Backend Platform Gaps
The current Express API surface only supports foundational authentication and community CRUD, leaving product-critical domains
such as feeds, search, analytics, moderation, and notifications without any server support. Missing orchestration layers mean
multi-step workflows (community creation, instructor onboarding, admin approvals) cannot be completed end-to-end, and
integration hooks for external services (email, search, live sessions) do not exist. Inconsistent response envelopes and minimal
validation undermine client reliability, while permissive defaults (wildcard CORS with credentials, weak password policies,
hard-coded database credentials) create immediate security liabilities. Error handling lacks environment hardening—JWT secrets
are not validated at startup, malformed auth headers log nothing, and the global handler exposes internal messages—making the
backend fragile and non-compliant with the enterprise positioning described in product narratives.

## Dependency and Tooling Risks
Across repos, dependency choices stop at scaffolding and omit the infrastructure needed to deliver real product flows. Axios is
installed but unused in React, Flutter lacks any HTTP, state, or analytics packages, and the backend has no job queues, cache, or
notification tooling despite references in the UI. The organisation lacks dependency governance: there are no automated audits,
lockfile coordination, or environment version guidance, increasing the likelihood of drift and unpatched CVEs. Without workspace
management, shared code, or CI-integrated checks, each project will evolve in isolation and make future integrations slow and
error-prone.

## Database Foundation Deficiencies
Database schema design mirrors the minimal feature set and omits tables for feeds, search indexes, payments, or telemetry, so the
database cannot support the roadmap marketed in the clients. There is no migrations regime beyond manual scripts, leaving schema
evolution uncontrolled and raising the risk of data loss during updates. Administrative safeguards are absent: seeds use
hard-coded credentials, there is no role-based access enforcement at the database level, sensitive fields lack encryption, and
compliance controls (GDPR deletion, consent tracking) are unaddressed. Operational visibility is equally limited; no health
checks, slow-query monitoring, or capacity planning is defined.

## Front-End Product Maturity Issues
The React application provides visually rich pages but every route depends on static mock data, so user actions like joining a
community or launching a workspace have no real effect. Forms are uncontrolled, submit empty payloads, and lack validation and
error messaging, making even basic authentication unusable. Accessibility and responsiveness gaps—missing labels, focus
management issues, absent loading states—will frustrate users and fail conformance reviews. Because there is no API abstraction,
configuration system, or defensive data handling, any attempt to wire the UI to live services will result in brittle code and
frequent runtime failures.

## Mobile App Readiness Concerns
The Flutter companion app mirrors the same limitations: screens are populated with placeholder content, buttons perform no
operations, and navigation lacks depth. Without HTTP clients, state management, persistence, or error flows, the app cannot
support authentication, feed consumption, or offline scenarios promised in launch messaging. Mobile usability is further hurt by
layout overflow risks, missing validation, and absent keyboard management, while security is compromised by the lack of secure
storage and any plan for TLS enforcement once networking is added.
