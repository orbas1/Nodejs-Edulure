# Provider Phone App – Change Log

## 2024-06-18 – Capability & RBAC Bootstrap Foundations
- Added capability manifest and RBAC repositories tailored for the provider mobile app, including scoped caching and API audience routing to isolate provider telemetry from consumer traffic.
- Delivered a ProviderAppBootstrap harness that primes Hive, loads the provider-specific manifest, hydrates the RBAC matrix, and exposes parity evaluation helpers for onboarding future Flutter modules.
- Documented access evaluation envelopes so provider squads can audit consent requirements, guardrail thresholds, and audit log templates before wiring new surfaces.
