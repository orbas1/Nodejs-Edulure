# Version 1.50 Design Progress Tracker

## Snapshot
Design work is mid-discovery with early component consolidation. Research artefacts are nearly half complete, the design system freeze is underway, and feature-level detailing has only recently started. Scores below reflect critical assessment of available artefacts, outstanding risks, and validation coverage.

### Metric Overview (0–100%)
| Workstream | Design Quality | Design Organisation | Design Position | Design Text Grade | Design Colour Grade | Design Render Grade | Compliance Grade | Security Grade | Design Functionality Grade | Design Images Grade | Design Usability Grade | Bugs-less Grade | Test Grade | QA Grade | Design Accuracy Grade | Overall Grade |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Application Experience (Flutter) | 65 | 60 | 58 | 62 | 64 | 55 | 52 | 50 | 57 | 60 | 55 | 48 | 45 | 40 | 58 | 55 |
| Web Application Experience | 70 | 66 | 64 | 68 | 72 | 60 | 58 | 52 | 62 | 65 | 60 | 50 | 48 | 42 | 63 | 59 |
| Shared Design System & Governance | 68 | 72 | 70 | 65 | 75 | 58 | 60 | 55 | 63 | 62 | 58 | 52 | 50 | 46 | 66 | 61 |

### Interpretation
- **Design Quality:** High-level compositions are coherent, but finalised redlines and interaction states are pending, lowering confidence.
- **Design Organisation & Position:** Information architecture is mostly defined, yet edge-case flows (e.g., affiliate escalations) still need mapping.
- **Text & Colour Grades:** Copy and token workstreams are progressing; compliance/legal copy is not signed off, keeping grades below 75.
- **Render & Functionality Grades:** High-fidelity renders exist for priority screens, but dynamic states and responsive breakpoints remain incomplete.
- **Compliance & Security:** Settings and moderation flows lack final review, keeping compliance/security awareness at or below 60.
- **Usability & Bugs-less Grades:** Early usability tests uncovered navigation hesitations and readability concerns; mitigation backlog remains open.
- **Test & QA Grades:** Formal accessibility, localisation, and design QA cycles are scheduled for Milestone 4; hence grades remain below 50.
- **Design Accuracy:** Cross-platform parity is improving, but parity gaps across Flutter/web components keep accuracy under 70.

## Milestone Progress Alignment
| Milestone | Target Week | Current Completion | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Milestone 1 – Discovery & Alignment Complete | Week 2 | 45% | Majority of interviews complete; analytics requirements and decision log still in progress. |
| Milestone 2 – Cross-Platform Design System Frozen | Week 4 | 30% | Token audit underway; motion guidance and accessibility baselines still outstanding. |
| Milestone 3 – Feature Surface Detailing | Week 6 | 20% | Initial high-fidelity frames approved for home/dashboard; explorer and settings flows pending. |
| Milestone 4 – Design QA & Engineering Handoff | Week 8 | 10% | QA resourcing and handoff checklist drafted but awaiting earlier milestone outputs. |

## Task Progress Highlights
- Research & Experience Alignment: 45% – usability sessions nearly complete; telemetry mapping pending final approval.
- Cross-Platform Design System Consolidation: 30% – tokens and component audits in progress; accessibility backlog identified.
- Application Experience Detailing: 25% – navigation and home flows documented; media viewers and Communities 2.0 states still early.
- Web Experience Detailing: 20% – navigation and homepage modules defined; explorer and settings variations in drafting.
- Design QA & Engineering Handoff: 10% – audit checklist prepared; no formal QA runs executed yet.

## Next Steps
1. Close outstanding analytics and telemetry requirements to solidify Milestone 1 exit criteria.
2. Finalise token governance and accessibility baselines to progress Milestone 2.
3. Accelerate explorer, Communities 2.0, and settings detailing to unlock engineering handoff dependencies.
4. Schedule accessibility and localisation QA resources two weeks ahead of Milestone 4 to avoid bottlenecks.
