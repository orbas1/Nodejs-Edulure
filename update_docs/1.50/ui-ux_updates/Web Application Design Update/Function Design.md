# Functional Design Considerations

## Key Workflows
- **Content Publishing:** Streamlined 4-step wizard (Details → Media → Pricing → Review) accessible from global "Create" button.
- **Community Management:** Hub with modular widgets (announcements, events, leaderboards) allowing drag-and-drop reordering.
- **Learner Journey:** Unified home feed blending resume cards, recommended communities, saved items, and upcoming events.
- **Affiliate & Monetisation:** Dashboard summarising earnings, pending payouts, referral links, and commission settings.

## Role-Based Experiences
- **Learner:** Focus on discovery, resume actions, and community engagement. Hide advanced monetisation tools.
- **Provider:** Prioritise asset uploads, analytics, and community configuration. Provide inline tips referencing updated workflows.
- **Admin:** Access to audit logs, compliance settings, role management, and feature toggles; shares components with provider but surfaces additional tabs.

## Cross-Platform Consistency
- Align with provider and user app wireframe updates to ensure navigation patterns remain consistent.
- Tokenise theming, spacing, and typography for reuse across React (web) and Flutter (mobile) builds.
- Provide shared asset previews and follow system interactions consistent with new logic flow definitions.

## Performance & Feedback
- Use skeleton loaders and optimistic UI for follow/like interactions.
- Provide background processing status for uploads and conversions accessible via notification tray.
- Batch API requests when loading dashboards to reduce time-to-interaction.

## Analytics & Telemetry
- Embed tracking IDs for every major interaction (CTA clicks, filter changes, search usage).
- Provide analytics summary inside settings to show data usage and follower insights.
- Align metrics with change log (communities 2.0, explorer improvements) to measure success of release.
