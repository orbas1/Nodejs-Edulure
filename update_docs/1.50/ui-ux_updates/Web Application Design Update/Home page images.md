# Home Page Imagery Guidelines

## Hero Imagery
- Use abstract gradient background referencing brand palette.
- Overlay with vector illustration showing collaboration (provider + learners) to highlight communities 2.0.
- Provide alternative illustration for provider vs. learner persona (asset upload vs. collaborative study).

## Section Imagery
- Resume strip uses course cover thumbnails (auto-generated from uploaded decks/ebooks) with subtle drop shadows.
- Community highlights display custom avatars or uploaded banners; fallback to gradient + icon if missing.
- Events module includes host avatars and calendar icons.

## Asset Requirements
- Format: SVG for icons, PNG/WebP for illustrative assets.
- Dimensions: Hero 1440x480; community banners 600x240; card thumbnails 320x180.
- Provide dark/light theme variants stored in `images_and_vectors` folder.

## Accessibility
- Ensure alt text describes purpose ("Illustration of provider uploading course materials").
- Avoid text embedded in images; overlay textual info using HTML/CSS for localisation.
