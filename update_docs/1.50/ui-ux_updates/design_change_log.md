# Version 1.50 Design Change Log

## Executive Summary
Version 1.50 delivers the most comprehensive UI/UX alignment in the Edulure product line to date. The release responds to learner feedback on clarity of progress, provider requests for faster cohort oversight, and marketing directives to emphasize the platform’s collaborative learning narrative. Every surface now inherits from a unified design system grounded in accessibility (WCAG 2.2 AA), motion restraint, and responsive adaptability across Flutter, React Native wrappers, and the core React web experience. The program of work spans 143 component updates, 57 net-new interface patterns, and 33 decommissioned legacy layouts.

## Design Program Objectives
1. **Create a Cohesive Multi-Platform Language** – Align typography, color, iconography, and spacing tokens to remove inconsistencies between learner, provider, and web surfaces.
2. **Improve Decision Velocity** – Ensure the most important actions (resume learning, review submissions, respond to learners) are discoverable above the fold within one interaction.
3. **Increase Conversion & Retention** – Support marketing funnels and habit loops with richer storytelling, contextual nudges, and persistent progression cues.
4. **Raise Accessibility Baselines** – Deliver measurable improvements in readability, input affordances, and alternative navigation paths for keyboard and screen-reader users.
5. **Accelerate Delivery & QA** – Document exhaustive wireframes, logic flows, and styling tokens to compress implementation cycles and reduce regression defects.

## Cross-Platform Foundations
### Design System Tokens
- **Typography:** Adopted Inter Variable with optical sizing enabled; defined typographic scale `H00 (44/54)`, `H0 (36/44)`, `H1 (28/36)`, `H2 (24/32)`, `H3 (20/28)`, `Body Large (18/26)`, `Body Default (16/24)`, `Body Small (14/22)`, and `Caption (12/18)` across all surfaces. Line heights tuned for readability on small screens.
- **Color Palette:** Refined semantic tokens: `Primary/Indigo-600`, `Primary/Indigo-500`, `Secondary/Sapphire-500`, `Success/Emerald-500`, `Warning/Amber-500`, `Error/Crimson-600`, `Background/Base-950`, `Background/Elevated-900`, `Surface-800`, `Stroke-700`, `Muted-600`. Extended neutrals for dark/light modes with explicit tone mapping for charting.
- **Spacing & Layout:** Standardized `4px` spacing multiplier with core increments `[4,8,12,16,20,24,32,40,48,64]`. Introduced responsive container widths: `mobile (360-480px)`, `tablet (768px)`, `desktop (1280px)`, `wide (1440px+)`.
- **Elevation & Shadows:** Created three elevation tiers with tokenized RGBA drop shadows and blur radii to harmonize depth cues across Flutter (Material) and web (CSS).
- **Iconography:** Shifted to duotone outline icon set with consistent stroke widths and aligned naming conventions for asset pipeline automation.

### Interaction Principles
- **Motion:** Reduced animation durations to 180ms and eased curves to `easeOutCubic` for consistent feel; introduced motion guidelines for entrance, state change, and micro-interaction feedback.
- **State Management:** Standardized success, warning, and error messaging with inline status bars and toast notifications (auto-dismiss after 5s with manual close).
- **Accessibility:** Added focus-visible outlines (#A5B4FC) for keyboard navigation, enriched alt text requirements for imagery, and mandated 44x44px minimum hit targets on touch controls.
