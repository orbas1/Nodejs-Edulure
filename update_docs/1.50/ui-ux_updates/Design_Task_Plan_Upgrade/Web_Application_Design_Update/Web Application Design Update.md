# Web Application Design Update Plan – Version 1.50

## Objectives
- Align marketing, onboarding, and authenticated dashboard experiences with the refreshed Edulure design system.
- Improve navigation clarity and conversion funnels by re-architecting layout, typography, and CTA placement.
- Enhance accessibility (WCAG 2.2 AA) and performance metrics (LCP < 2.5s, CLS < 0.1) across desktop and tablet breakpoints.
- Provide comprehensive documentation enabling efficient implementation and QA coverage.

## Workstreams
| Workstream | Scope | Owner | Key Outputs |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Marketing Refresh | Home, Cohort catalog, Cohort detail, Pricing, Resources landing | Web UX Lead | Wireframes, copy deck, hero imagery specs |
| Authenticated Dashboard | Overview, Cohort management, Analytics, Resource library, Settings | Product Designer | Interaction prototypes, component specs |
| Navigation & IA | Global header, contextual sidebar, command palette, breadcrumbs | Design Systems | Navigation schema, accessibility notes |
| Component Library | Cards, tables, charts, forms, modals | Design Systems | Updated tokens, Storybook entries |
| Accessibility & QA | Contrast audits, keyboard navigation, screen reader support | Accessibility Guild | Audit reports, remediation checklist |

## Deliverables
- Low- and high-fidelity mockups for all page templates across breakpoints (1280, 1440, responsive down to 768).
- Interaction prototypes for navigation, command palette, analytics filtering, and messaging panel.
- Component specification sheets covering states (default, hover, active, disabled), responsive behavior, and data bindings.
- Copy deck for marketing sections, CTA text, tooltips, and error messaging.
- Asset manifests (illustrations, icons, imagery) with file formats and optimization guidelines.

## Timeline
1. **Discovery & IA (Week 1)** – Conduct content audits, stakeholder interviews, finalize sitemap and navigation blueprint.
2. **Wireframes (Weeks 1-2)** – Produce annotated wireframes for marketing and dashboard flows; review with Product & Marketing.
3. **High Fidelity (Weeks 2-4)** – Apply visual design, refine interactions, integrate new illustrations.
4. **Handoff (Week 4)** – Prepare spec documentation, deliver assets, host engineering walkthrough.
5. **Implementation Support (Weeks 5-6)** – Address implementation questions, update documentation as needed, attend QA reviews.

## Success Metrics
- Increase homepage CTA engagement by 25% and reduce bounce rate by 15% compared to previous release.
- Improve dashboard task completion rates (publish lesson, review analytics) by 20% in usability tests.
- Achieve accessibility audit score ≥95% with no critical issues outstanding.
- Engineering satisfaction ≥4.5/5 on documentation quality survey.

## Risks & Mitigation
- **Content Dependencies:** Marketing copy/illustrations may be delayed. Mitigation: create placeholders with style guides, escalate blockers early.
- **Performance Regressions:** Richer visuals can affect load times. Mitigation: define asset budgets, use lazy loading strategies.
- **Navigation Complexity:** New IA may confuse existing users. Mitigation: provide onboarding tooltips, update help documentation, run usability tests.

## Post-Launch Monitoring
- Track analytics on navigation usage (command palette invocations, sidebar toggles).
- Monitor conversion funnels (homepage → catalog → enrollment) and adjust CTAs as needed.
- Gather support feedback to refine copy or layout.
