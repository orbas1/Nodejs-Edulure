# Layout Organisation & Component Positioning â€“ Web Application v1.50

## Grid System
- Desktop: 12-column grid, 72px max content width 1200px, gutters 24px. Body content centered with max width 1280px.
- Tablet: 8-column grid, gutters 20px. Mobile: 4-column grid, gutters 16px.

## Key Page Layouts
- **Marketing Pages:** Full-width hero followed by alternating background sections. Use equal height cards for value pillars and case studies.
- **Dashboard:** Sidebar width 260px, main content 960px. Right rail 320px for supplementary widgets.
- **Resource Library:** Filter column 280px, content grid responsive (3 columns desktop, 2 tablet, 1 mobile).

## Component Placement
- CTAs positioned near top of fold and repeated near section end.
- Support contact surfaced in footer and floating help button on dashboard.
- Breadcrumbs located below header, above page title.

## Responsive Adjustments
- On <1024px, sidebar collapses to top nav with dropdown. Right rail content moves below main sections.
- Charts convert to simplified sparkline cards on mobile.

## Spacing Rhythm
- Section spacing: 80px marketing, 48px dashboard. Component-level spacing multiples of 8px.

## Safe Areas
- Ensure content respects 24px padding at edges on desktop, 16px on mobile. Avoid text flush to edges.

## Scroll Behavior
- Use sticky navigation for sidebar and filters. Provide "Back to top" button after long sections.
