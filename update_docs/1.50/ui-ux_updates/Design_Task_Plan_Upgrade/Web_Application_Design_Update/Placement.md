# CTA & Component Placement Guidelines â€“ Web Application v1.50

## Primary CTAs
- Homepage hero: primary CTA on left column above fold, repeated after value pillars.
- Cohort detail: sticky CTA in right column for enrollment/waitlist.
- Pricing: CTA below each plan card and repeated after FAQ.

## Secondary Actions
- Provide contextual secondary actions near primary CTAs (e.g., "Download syllabus" next to "Enroll").
- Use tertiary links for resource exploration ("View all case studies").

## Support & Trust Signals
- Place social proof near CTAs to reinforce decision (testimonials near enrollment buttons).
- Include security badges or guarantee copy near payment CTAs.

## Sticky Elements
- Sticky sidebar on dashboard for quick actions.
- Floating help button bottom-right across authenticated pages.
- Back-to-top button appears after user scrolls 50% down page.

## Mobile Considerations
- Place primary CTA above fold; use sticky bottom bar for persistent actions (Enroll, Start Trial).
- Collapse secondary links into accordions or menus to reduce clutter.

## Analytics
- Track CTA placement performance (hero vs mid-page) to inform future iterations.
