# Settings Architecture â€“ Web Application v1.50

## Sections
- Account Information (profile, contact details, timezone)
- Preferences (theme, language, content density)
- Notifications (channel matrix, quiet hours, email digest)
- Security (password, MFA, device management, API keys)
- Billing (plan, invoices, payment methods)
- Team Management (invitations, roles, permissions)

## Interaction Patterns
- Use tabs or sidebar navigation within settings to switch between sections.
- Provide inline validation, success/error states, and descriptive helper text.
- Display unsaved changes indicator and confirmation dialogs for destructive actions.

## Accessibility
- Ensure focus states visible; support screen readers with appropriate `aria` attributes.
- Provide skip links to main content.

## Analytics
- Track settings interactions for adoption metrics (MFA enablement, notification preferences, plan changes).
