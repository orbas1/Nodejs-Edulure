# Imagery & Vector Assets â€“ Web Application v1.50

## Asset Requirements
- Hero illustrations (6) with light/dark variants.
- Icon set (duotone) covering navigation, features, statuses.
- Pattern backgrounds for section separators.
- Decorative vectors for case studies and testimonials.

## Export Specs
- Illustrations: SVG primary, PNG fallback (1x/2x). Maintain <400KB.
- Icons: 24px, 32px, 48px in SVG. Provide optimized sprite sheet.
- Patterns: SVG with ability to tile, include opacity masks for subtle overlays.

## Usage Guidelines
- Maintain consistent stroke width and color palette. Use gradients defined in color guidelines.
- Avoid overusing decorative vectors in data-dense sections to keep focus on content.
- Provide alt text or mark decorative elements as `aria-hidden` depending on purpose.

## Workflow
- Store in `/update_docs/1.50/assets/web/vectors`. Include README with attribution/license.
- Track version changes and notify engineering when updates occur.
