# SCSS

- Structure partials: `_variables.scss`, `_mixins.scss`, `_layout.scss`, `_components.scss`.
- Mixins for gradients, focus rings, and responsive breakpoints.
- Functions to generate spacing scale and z-index layers.
- Use maps for semantic colours and iterate to produce utility classes.
- Compile with autoprefixer to support modern browsers.
