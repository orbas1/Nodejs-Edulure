# Home Page Imagery Plan â€“ Web Application v1.50

## Hero Imagery
- Primary hero: illustration depicting collaborative learning with gradient background. Provide static image + optional looped video (10s, muted, autoplay with pause control).
- Secondary variant: photograph of learners in cohort session for A/B testing.

## Social Proof
- Partner logos in monochrome to maintain visual consistency. Provide vector versions with transparent backgrounds.
- Testimonial avatars: professional headshots with circular crop, consistent lighting.

## Value Pillars
- Iconography representing features (live sessions, mentorship, projects, community). Use duotone icon style.
- Background shapes with soft gradients (#EEF2FF, #DBEAFE).

## Cohort Showcase
- Thumbnail images for featured cohorts (project-based scenes, instructors). Maintain aspect ratio 16:9.
- Provide fallback gradient backgrounds with cohort initials for missing imagery.

## Success Stories
- Case study hero images with overlay gradient to ensure text readability.
- Video thumbnail frames with play button overlay, accessible alt text.

## Resource Highlights
- Blog post imagery aligned with topic; use consistent color grading.
- Placeholder image for posts without media.

## Optimization
- Export hero images as AVIF/WebP with JPEG fallback (<350KB). Use responsive sources for 480px, 768px, 1280px widths.
- Defer loading of below-the-fold images via lazy loading.

## Accessibility
- Provide alt text describing context ("Mentor hosting live cohort session via video call").
- Ensure video hero includes captions or transcript if audio present.
