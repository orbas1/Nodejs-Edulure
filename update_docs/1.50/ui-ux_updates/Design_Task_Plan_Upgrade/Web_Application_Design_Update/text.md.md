# Copy & Microcopy Standards – Web Application v1.50

## Voice & Tone
- Professional yet friendly, emphasizing partnership and outcomes.
- Use active voice and avoid jargon; provide context for technical terms.

## Microcopy Patterns
- Buttons: action-oriented verbs ("Enroll Now", "View Analytics").
- Toasts: concise feedback with next step ("Lesson published. Share with your cohort?").
- Error messages: human-friendly explanation + remediation ("We couldn’t process your payment. Try another card or contact support.").
- Empty states: empathetic encouragement + CTA ("No insights yet. Collect more learner activity to unlock recommendations.").

## Accessibility & Inclusivity
- Avoid gendered language; use inclusive pronouns.
- Provide descriptive alt text and transcripts for multimedia.

## Localization Support
- Keep strings under 60 characters when possible. Provide placeholders with context notes.
- Avoid idioms or culturally specific references.

## Content Governance
- Maintain copy deck with string IDs, owner, status.
- Review copy quarterly with Product Marketing.
