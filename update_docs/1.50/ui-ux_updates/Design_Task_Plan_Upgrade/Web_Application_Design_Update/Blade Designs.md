# Blade Designs

- Laravel blade templates modularised into layout (header/footer), sections (hero, cards, modals), and partials (navigation, footers).
- Use component slots for card variations and modal contents.
- Include blade directives for localisation and feature flags.
- Ensure SSR outputs accessible markup with correct aria attributes.
