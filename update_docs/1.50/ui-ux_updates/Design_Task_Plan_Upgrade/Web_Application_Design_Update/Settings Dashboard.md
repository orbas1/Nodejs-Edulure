# Settings Dashboard Overview â€“ Web Application v1.50

## Navigation
- Settings accessible via sidebar link and account menu. Landing page displays summary cards linking to sub-sections (Account, Preferences, Notifications, Security, Billing, Team).

## Layout
- Two-column layout (content 70%, summary sidebar 30%). On tablet/mobile, collapse to single column with sticky sub-navigation at top.

## Summary Sidebar
- Cards showing key info: profile completion, notification preferences, security status (MFA enabled?), billing status (next invoice), team invites.
- Include quick actions (Enable MFA, Update Payment Method).

## Content Sections
- Each section uses card-based layout with forms/toggles.
- Provide breadcrumbs and "Back to Settings" link.

## Interactions
- Auto-save toggles; forms require Save button with confirmation toast.
- For sensitive updates, prompt re-auth modal.

## Accessibility
- Ensure keyboard focus order flows from summary to content sections logically.
- Provide aria labels for summary cards indicating action.

## Analytics
- Track settings navigation and completion rates of key actions (`settings_enable_mfa`, `settings_update_payment`).
