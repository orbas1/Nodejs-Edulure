## Layout Considerations
- Use alternating background colors/gradients to differentiate sections.
- Ensure CTAs appear every 2 sections to reinforce conversion paths.
- Provide anchor navigation for quick section access.

## Responsiveness
- Desktop: multi-column layouts for testimonials/pillars. Tablet: two columns. Mobile: stacked sections with carousels for horizontal scroll.
- Ensure hero illustration scales gracefully; fallback static image for lower bandwidth.

## Accessibility & SEO
- Structured headings (H1 hero, H2 sections). Include schema markup for FAQs and reviews.
- Alt text for imagery and transcripts/captions for video hero.
- Ensure focus order matches reading order, and skip-to-content link available.
