# Screen Text Guidelines – Application Design Update v1.50

## Voice & Tone
- Adopt supportive, expert, and motivational tone. Use active voice and second person to guide users ("You can join the live session in 10 minutes").
- Maintain inclusive language; avoid jargon; provide definitions for specialized terms.
- For provider app, use operational language emphasizing clarity and actionability.

## Microcopy Standards
- Primary actions use verb-first labels ("Resume Lesson", "Publish Cohort").
- Confirmation dialogs summarise action impact and provide reassurance ("You can restore this lesson later from History").
- Empty states include empathetic message + clear CTA ("No assignments due today. Review upcoming tasks to stay ahead.").

## Error Messaging
- Use plain language explaining issue and resolution ("Upload failed because the file exceeds 100MB. Try compressing before uploading again.").
- Provide links to help articles where relevant. Avoid blame language.

## Success & Feedback
- Celebrate achievements with concise messaging ("Streak secured! You’ve learned 3 days in a row.").
- Provide next best action suggestions in success toasts ("Feedback sent. Review cohort analytics next.").

## Accessibility Considerations
- Avoid using color-dependent language (e.g., "Tap the green button"). Refer to button label or icon instead.
- Provide alt text for imagery describing purpose not appearance.
- Ensure voiceover order matches visual hierarchy.

## Localization
- Maintain strings under 60 characters when possible to accommodate translations.
- Avoid idioms that may not translate well.
- Prepare context notes for translation team clarifying placeholders and pluralization.

## Content Maintenance
- Create copy deck within design documentation referencing string IDs.
- Provide fallback copy for scenarios where data missing ("Information unavailable. Refresh to try again.").
- Review copy quarterly with Product Marketing to ensure messaging alignment.
