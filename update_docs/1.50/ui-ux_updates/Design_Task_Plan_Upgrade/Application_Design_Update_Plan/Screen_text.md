# Screen Text

## Tone & Voice
- Confident, instructive, and community-forward with direct verbs and inclusive language.
- Balance motivational cues ("Keep the momentum") with operational clarity ("Conversion in progress").
- Avoid jargon; explain new concepts with short tooltips or info banners.

## Copy Patterns
- **Headlines:** Action-focused, e.g., "Pick up where you left off", "Share your next deck".
- **Supporting Text:** Short sentences providing value proposition or context, limited to 80 characters.
- **Microcopy:** Provide immediate guidance such as "Slides convert automatically with narration support" or "Members you invite can join once approval is granted".
- **Error Messages:** Describe issue, impact, and solution, e.g., "Upload paused because connection dropped. We will resume when you're back online.".
- **Empty States:** Encourage action with relevant next steps, e.g., "No events scheduled yet. Plan your first session to engage your community.".

## Accessibility & Localisation
- Ensure key actions include text labels even when accompanied by icons.
- Prepare copy for localisation by avoiding embedded variables mid-sentence; use placeholders with fallback values.
- Provide text expansion buffer; allow up to 30% length increase for translated copy.
- Tone remains respectful and neutral across different cultures and time zones.
