# Screen Text

- Tone: confident, instructive, community-driven. Use active verbs ("Resume", "Publish", "Join").
- Provide microcopy for new features (e.g., "Slides convert automatically with narration support").
- Notification labels align with governance: "Follow request awaiting review", "Affiliate payout initiated".
- Empty states: encourage exploration ("No saved searches yet—try filtering by Communities to discover new groups").
- Accessibility: ensure alt text and aria labels describe purpose ("Leaderboard – ranked by tier points this week").
