# Logic Flow Update Summary – Application Design Update v1.50

## Learner Workflows
### Onboarding
- Step 1: Account creation (email/SSO) → verify email → set password → accept terms.
- Step 2: Profile setup collects avatar, name, pronouns, interests, time zone; autosaves on field blur.
- Step 3: Cohort discovery surfaces recommended cohorts; selecting cohort triggers enrollment confirmation modal.
- Step 4: Orientation checklist tracks tasks; completion unlocks streak tracking.

### Daily Engagement
- App launch triggers background sync; timeline prioritized using urgency scores.
- Focus actions (Resume, Join Live, Review Notes) evaluate prerequisites before navigation.
- Lessons track progress increments; completion dispatches events updating profile and analytics.
- Assignments maintain state machine (Not Started → In Progress → Submitted → Graded). Feedback arrival triggers notification update.

### Community Interaction
- Chat hub uses real-time updates; message composition handles offline queueing.
- Reactions, mentions, and file shares update conversation metadata and notifications.

## Provider Workflows
### Cohort Management
- Create cohort wizard validates prerequisites; final publish triggers notifications to learners and updates dashboards.
- Active cohort management: attendance updates feed into health score algorithm; risk thresholds create alerts.
- Archiving process ensures all data exported, learners notified, and analytics updated.

### Content Publishing
- Lesson builder stepper ensures metadata, content blocks, interactions complete before enabling Publish.
- Scheduling integrates with calendar service; conflicts prompt resolution flow.

### Messaging & Support
- Messaging hub prioritizes threads by SLA. Saved replies inserted with tokens replaced via context.
- Support console integrates knowledge base search and ticket escalations.

### Analytics Review
- Providers apply filters (cohort, time range). Data fetched asynchronously; insights generated via rule engine. Actions (download report, create task) propagate to respective services.

## Error & Recovery
- Network failures queue actions; UI displays offline banner with retry.
- Validation errors highlight fields; summary banner anchors to first issue.
- Critical errors route to fallback screen with support contact.

## Automation Enhancements
- Introduced rule builder enabling triggers (missed session, low engagement) with actions (send message, assign resource).
- Automation logs available for auditing and debugging.
