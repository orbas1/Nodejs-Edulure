# Logic Flow Update

## Objectives
- Ensure each primary task (upload, schedule, discover, manage followers) has clear entry point and minimal context switching.
- Align flows with backend readiness: asynchronous operations use optimistic UI updates with error recovery.
- Provide guardrails (confirmations, inline policy messaging) for compliance-sensitive actions like paywall changes.

## Key Adjustments
1. Introduced global event bus to sync notifications across dashboard widgets and settings.
2. Added retry states and offline cache for media uploads on mobile.
3. Extended search flow to support saved queries and multi-select filters.
4. Enhanced settings flow to include review + confirm step for monetisation toggles.
