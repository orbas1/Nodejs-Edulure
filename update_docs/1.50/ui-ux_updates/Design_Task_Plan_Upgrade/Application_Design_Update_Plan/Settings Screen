# Settings Screen Blueprint â€“ Application Design Update v1.50

## Structure
- Header with avatar, name, role, quick link to view public profile.
- Section navigation using segmented control (Account, Preferences, Notifications, Security, Billing, Support).
- Each section represented by card-based layout with grouped controls.

## Section Details
### Account
- Fields: Name, Pronouns, Email, Phone, Time Zone. Inline validation and edit/save controls.
- Profile visibility toggle with explanatory microcopy.

### Preferences
- Theme selection (Light, Dark, Auto). Language dropdown with preview. Content density toggle.
- Reminders configuration (Daily digest, Weekly summary).

### Notifications
- Matrix of channels (Push, Email, SMS) vs event types (Assignments, Live Sessions, Billing, Community, System).
- Quiet hours scheduler with start/end time pickers.

### Security
- Password management, MFA setup (Authenticator app, SMS), device management list with revoke action.
- Session history table with location, device, timestamp.

### Billing
- Plan summary, renewal date, payment method management, invoice history with download links.
- Referral credit status and redemption CTA.

### Support
- Quick links to help center, contact support, submit feedback. Provide log export button.

## Interaction Patterns
- Sticky save bar for sections requiring explicit save. Auto-save for toggles and checkboxes.
- Success toasts displayed after save; error states highlight fields and surface summary at top.
- Provide breadcrumbs when accessed via deep link.

## Accessibility
- Focus order follows visual grouping. All controls labeled and have descriptive helper text.
- Support keyboard navigation and screen readers with appropriate roles/aria attributes.

## QA Considerations
- Test dynamic type scaling, localization, offline error handling, and re-auth flows for sensitive actions.
