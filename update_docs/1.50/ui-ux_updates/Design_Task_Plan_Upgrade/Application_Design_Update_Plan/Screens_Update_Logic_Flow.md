# Screens Update Logic Flow

1. User authenticates; global navigation loads user role to display correct dashboard variant.
2. Dashboard widgets fetch analytics aggregates; quick actions leverage same context to prefill forms.
3. Selecting media asset transitions from library view → detail → conversion timeline.
4. Completion triggers toast and prompts sharing or scheduling follow-up event.
5. Community alerts open hub with pre-filtered channel or event, enabling quick moderation or RSVP.
6. Settings entry from avatar or notification resolves to correct subsection with context crumb.
7. Global search overlay can be invoked at any point, pushing results and enabling deep link navigation.
8. Offline detection reroutes flows to cached views and queues pending actions for background sync.
