# Screens Update

## Overview
- Prioritise dashboards, media viewers, community hubs, explorer, and settings for alignment with Version 1.50 initiatives.
- Adopt modular component library to reuse headers, stats cards, leaderboards, and chat docks across mobile and web shells.
- Sequence updates according to dependencies: shared navigation shell → dashboard widgets → media experiences → explorer.

## Goals
1. Maintain parity between provider, learner, and admin views for shared modules.
2. Reduce task completion time for media upload, community event scheduling, and discovery.
3. Embed analytics and feedback loops within each screen to support data-driven iteration.
