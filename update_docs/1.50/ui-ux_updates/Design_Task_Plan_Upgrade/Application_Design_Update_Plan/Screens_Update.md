# Screens Update Overview â€“ Application Design Update v1.50

## Scope & Coverage
Version 1.50 touches 68 learner-facing screens and 54 provider-facing screens across mobile applications. This document catalogs each cluster, outlines the redesign intent, and specifies the fidelity of deliverables (wireframes, UI specs, interaction notes).

## Objectives
- Harmonize layout hierarchies with the shared design system to reduce cognitive load and development overhead.
- Surface mission-critical content within the first scroll, prioritizing next-best actions for learners and operational metrics for providers.
- Support accessibility targets (WCAG 2.2 AA) with improved color contrast, hit targets, and semantic structure.
- Document responsive adjustments for small, medium, and large device breakpoints to ensure parity across phones and tablets.

## Screen Clusters & Highlights
1. **Home & Dashboard**
   - Learner home: hero redesign, focus shortcuts, timeline restructure, resource carousel, support chip integration.
   - Provider dashboard: KPI grid, action list, alerts rail, quick create overlay.
2. **Cohort & Lesson Management**
   - Cohort overview, curriculum, members, analytics, resources, messaging tabs.
   - Lesson player, interactive quiz, note workspace, attachments panel.
3. **Assignments & Assessments**
   - Assignment list, detail, submission form, rubric review, peer review flow, grading feedback.
4. **Messaging & Community**
   - Chat hub, conversation threads, reaction panels, event calendar, community feed.
5. **Profile & Settings**
   - Profile overview, skills/goals, achievements, billing, preferences, notifications, security.
6. **Onboarding & Authentication**
   - Welcome carousel, sign-up/login, verification, profile wizard, cohort discovery, orientation checklist.
7. **Support & Help**
   - Support console, FAQ search, ticket submission, progress tracking.

## Deliverable Requirements
- Low-fidelity wireframes for early reviews (Week 1) capturing layout and content hierarchy.
- High-fidelity mockups with component specifications, annotations, and state variants (Week 3).
- Interaction prototypes (Figma) for complex flows: lesson player, assignment submission, messaging, automation builder.
- Accessibility annotations (focus order, labels) for all interactive screens.

## Dependencies
- Updated icon pack (duotone) and illustration library delivered by Brand team.
- Design tokens (typography, color, spacing) approved in design_change_log.md.
- Analytics instrumentation requirements from Data team for new components (focus actions, support chip, automation builder).

## Risk & Mitigation
- **Risk:** Increased screen density could reduce clarity. **Mitigation:** Maintain 24px vertical rhythm and enforce content grouping guidelines.
- **Risk:** Platform divergence causing inconsistent experiences. **Mitigation:** Run cross-platform parity reviews, share component library, and maintain single source of truth in design system.
- **Risk:** Late asset delivery delaying high fidelity specs. **Mitigation:** Use placeholder art with documented dimensions; track asset status in shared board.
- **Risk:** Accessibility regressions introduced during redesign. **Mitigation:** Schedule mid-sprint accessibility audit and include QA acceptance criteria for focus order and contrast.

## Approval & Handoff
- Weekly design reviews with Product + Engineering leads; sign-off recorded in project tracker.
- Handoff package includes screen checklist, component references, redlines, and copy deck.
- Post-handoff support via dedicated Slack channel and office hours.
