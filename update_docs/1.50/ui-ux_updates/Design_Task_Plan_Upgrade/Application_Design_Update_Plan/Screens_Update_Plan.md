## Responsibilities
- **Design Lead:** Owns screen definitions, ensures alignment with product goals, coordinates reviews.
- **Design Ops:** Maintains documentation repository, version control, and asset management.
- **UX Writer:** Delivers copy deck and microcopy guidelines.
- **Accessibility Specialist:** Conducts audits and ensures compliance notes integrated.
- **QA Liaison:** Builds test plans based on screen specs.

## Review Cadence
- Daily async check-ins via project board; update status (In Progress, Review, Approved).
- Twice-weekly critique sessions to review screens and address feedback.
- End-of-week stakeholder review (Product, Engineering, Customer Success) with decision log.

## Tooling & Documentation
- Figma for design creation; components stored in shared library `Edulure v1.50`.
- FigJam for flow mapping and ideation.
- Confluence/Notion for documentation linking to repo files.
- Zeplin export for development redlines where required.

## Quality Gates
- Every screen must pass accessibility lint (contrast, touch target) before approval.
- Interaction prototypes required for dynamic experiences (lesson player, automation builder).
- Copy reviewed by UX writer and localized strings flagged for translation.

## Risk Management
- Track dependencies (illustrations, data requirements) in shared tracker with owners/dates.
- Escalate blockers within 24 hours; adjust scope or resources as needed.
- Maintain change log capturing scope additions with approvals.

## Success Criteria
- 100% of targeted screens delivered with approved specs by end of Week 4.
- QA sign-off indicating design documentation sufficient for regression coverage.
- Post-launch analytics demonstrate improved engagement on focus actions (target +20%).
