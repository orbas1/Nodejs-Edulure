# Layout Organisation & Component Positioning â€“ Application Design Update v1.50

## Home Screen Layout
- Top area reserved for hero module (height 220px) with progress summary and next action CTA.
- Focus action row positioned directly below hero with 16px spacing; uses horizontally scrollable layout on smaller devices.
- Timeline occupies majority of viewport; items grouped by day with sticky header for current date.
- Support chip anchored bottom-right above navigation bar at 16px offset.

## Cohort Detail Layout
- Hero block 200px height featuring cohort avatar, mentors, next session chip, action buttons (Invite, Share).
- Tab bar pinned beneath hero; uses 16px vertical spacing before content area.
- Content sections follow 24px vertical spacing; table/list components use 12px padding inside.

## Provider Dashboard Layout
- Two-column structure: main column 70% width for KPI cards, timeline, tasks; secondary column 30% for alerts and quick actions.
- Floating "Create" action button positioned bottom-right above nav bar.

## Messaging Hub Layout
- Three-panel structure on tablet/desktop: conversation folders (20%), thread list (30%), active conversation (50%). On mobile, collapses to stacked navigation with top tabs.
- Composer anchored bottom with safe area padding; attachments row above composer when files added.

## Calendar Layout
- Weekly view uses 7 columns, each 120px min width; timeline hours in first column (80px). Sessions displayed as blocks with 4px rounded corners and color-coded backgrounds.
- Agenda list view uses vertical list sorted by start time; includes sticky date separators.

## Settings Layout
- Profile header at top with avatar, name, role; edit button top-right.
- Sections segmented with cards containing fields; 32px spacing between sections.
- Save/Cancel buttons anchored bottom for long forms with gradient overlay to signal scroll completion.

## Responsiveness
- Breakpoints: 360px (mobile), 600px (small tablet), 768px (tablet), 1024px (desktop). Layout adjustments documented per breakpoint.
- On small devices, reduce hero height to 180px, stack metrics vertically, convert two-column layouts to single column.

## Safe Areas & Margins
- Maintain 16px margin on mobile edges, 24px on tablet, 32px on desktop.
- Respect OS safe area insets; bottom navigation sits above safe area to avoid overlap with gesture bar.

## Scroll Behavior
- Use sticky headers for timeline days, analytics filters, and settings sections for quick access.
- Provide "scroll to top" floating button when lists exceed 3 viewport heights.
