# Application Design Update

## Vision
Deliver a cohesive, mobile-first provider and learner experience that celebrates collaborative learning, media-rich courses, and community-driven growth while respecting the constraints of handheld sessions.

## Strategic Pillars
1. **Task-Centric Navigation:** Every primary user goal (resume, publish, manage communities) must be reachable within two taps from the home surface.
2. **Context Preservation:** Persist recently viewed media, active conversations, and analytics insights at the surface level to reduce task switching.
3. **Guided Discovery:** Blend algorithmic recommendations with curated editorial moments so learners and providers can discover assets, communities, and people with confidence.
4. **Operational Transparency:** Surface background tasks such as file conversions, sync status, and scheduled events with clear messaging, allowing users to act before issues escalate.
5. **Accessibility & Inclusivity:** Ensure text sizing, contrast, and motion adheres to WCAG 2.2 AA while offering quick toggles for dyslexia-friendly fonts and reduced animation modes.

## Release Objectives
- Harmonise the provider and learner shells so visual language, iconography, and interactions feel related yet purpose-built.
- Introduce modular dashboards that scale from compact phones to large tablets without compromising scannability.
- Support asynchronous collaboration through real-time indicators, offline fallbacks, and push notification routing.
- Align UI copy, settings language, and contextual help with the broader Version 1.50 platform updates.

## Success Metrics
- **Navigation Efficiency:** Reduce average taps-to-task by 20% for upload/publish and resume-learning flows.
- **Engagement:** Increase daily active learners viewing at least one recommended asset by 15%.
- **Support Load:** Decrease support tickets related to "where to find" or "stuck converting" issues by 25%.
- **Accessibility Adoption:** Achieve 30% opt-in for new accessibility controls within three months of launch.

## Dependencies
- Updated analytics microservices providing real-time metrics.
- Media conversion pipeline improvements for PowerPoint and ebook assets.
- Push notification orchestration supporting granular event types.
- Revised brand token library shared across mobile and web.

## Stakeholders
- **Product Design:** Owns UI systems, interaction patterns, and asset specifications.
- **Engineering:** Implements responsive layouts, animation states, and data integrations.
- **Content & Community:** Curates editorial modules and ensures copy alignment.
- **Support & Training:** Updates help centre, tooltips, and in-app walkthroughs.

## Delivery Roadmap
1. **Discovery Sprint:** Validate wireframes with provider and learner panels; document usability findings.
2. **Design System Sprint:** Finalise component tokens, iconography, and animation blueprints.
3. **Feature Sprint:** Iterate on dashboards, media viewers, and community hubs with clickable prototypes.
4. **Polish Sprint:** Conduct accessibility audits, refine microcopy, and prepare redlines for engineering.
5. **Handoff:** Package Zeplin/Figma specs, annotate logic flows, and schedule design QA checkpoints.
