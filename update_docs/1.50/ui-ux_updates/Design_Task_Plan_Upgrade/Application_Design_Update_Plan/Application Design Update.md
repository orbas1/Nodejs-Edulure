# Application Design Update

## Vision
Deliver cohesive, multi-platform experiences that celebrate collaborative learning, media-rich courses, and community-driven growth.

## Pillars
1. **Unified Navigation:** Shared shell across provider, learner, and admin contexts to simplify orientation.
2. **Media Excellence:** PowerPoint and ebook experiences emphasise clarity, offline support, and analytics.
3. **Community Gravity:** Communities 2.0 surfaces highlight engagement drivers, moderation, and monetisation.
4. **Discovery Everywhere:** Explorer entry points woven throughout to leverage Meilisearch investments.
5. **Governance & Trust:** Settings and audit trails make privacy, compliance, and payouts transparent.

## Next Steps
- Finalise token documentation with frontend/mobile teams.
- Build interactive prototypes for usability testing (providers, learners).
- Validate with QA to align automation scripts on UI states.
- Coordinate localisation plan for new text surfaces.
