# Application Design Update Plan – Version 1.50

## Objectives
- Deliver cohesive learner and provider mobile experiences aligned with refreshed brand guidelines and cross-platform design system tokens.
- Improve discoverability of mission-critical actions (resume learning, publish lessons, respond to messages) within two taps.
- Increase accessibility compliance (WCAG 2.2 AA) and support dynamic type, high contrast, and reduced motion preferences.
- Provide implementation-ready documentation for engineering, QA, and product teams including wireframes, component specs, and logic flows.

## Scope Overview
| Workstream | Description | Owner | Dependencies |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Foundation Tokens | Typography, color, spacing, elevation, iconography definition | Design Systems | Brand approvals, asset exports |
| Learner App Refresh | Home, cohort, learning, assignments, community, profile modules | Mobile Design | Analytics instrumentation, content strategy |
| Provider App Refresh | Dashboard, cohort management, scheduling, messaging, analytics | Mobile Design | Data architecture, automation rules |
| Accessibility | Focus states, contrast, screen reader labels, haptics | Accessibility Guild | QA accessibility audit |
| QA Enablement | Spec documentation, acceptance criteria, regression scripts | Design Ops | Product analytics, QA team |

## Deliverables
- Annotated wireframes for every screen variant (portrait, landscape, tablet) stored in Figma project `Edulure v1.50`.
- Component specification sheets covering states, interactions, data bindings, error handling, and responsive behavior.
- Logic flow diagrams for key journeys (onboarding, lesson consumption, assignment submission, cohort creation, messaging).
- Styling compendium detailing typographic scale, palette mapping, shadow tokens, icon usage, imagery guidelines.
- Accessibility checklist mapping each screen to compliance criteria and remediation tasks.

## Milestones
1. **Foundation Freeze (Week 1)** – finalize tokens, typography, palette, iconography, spacing. Publish design system update.
2. **Wireframe Iteration (Weeks 1-3)** – produce low-fidelity flows, conduct usability reviews with stakeholders, iterate based on feedback.
3. **High-Fidelity Spec (Weeks 2-4)** – apply visual styling, produce final comps, annotate interactions.
4. **Handoff (Week 4)** – export Zeplin/measurements, update documentation repository, schedule dev walkthrough.
5. **QA Support (Weeks 5-6)** – provide assets for test automation, participate in regression reviews, collect post-launch feedback.

## Success Metrics
- 90% of critical tasks validated within moderated usability sessions completing within target time (<45 seconds for resume lesson, <90 seconds for publishing a lesson).
- Accessibility audit scoring 95%+ pass rate with zero critical blockers.
- Reduction in support tickets related to navigation confusion by 30% within first month of release.
- Engineering feedback rating documentation clarity ≥4.5/5 in retro survey.

## Stakeholders & Collaboration
- Product Leads: align on feature prioritization and scope adjustments.
- Engineering: weekly sync to review feasibility, component reuse, and platform-specific considerations.
- Marketing & Brand: review hero illustrations, messaging alignment, tone of voice.
- Data & Analytics: ensure instrumentation requirements captured for new components.

## Risks & Mitigation
- **Scope Creep:** maintain change log and review board for late additions; enforce design freeze with sign-off process.
- **Platform Divergence:** cross-platform reviews to verify parity; share component libraries between Flutter and React teams.
- **Asset Delivery Delays:** set deadlines for illustration/icon exports; provide placeholders with color specs to unblock dev.
- **Accessibility Gaps:** schedule accessibility review at mid-sprint to catch issues early.

## Post-Launch Plan
- Monitor analytics dashboards for engagement metrics (focus tile taps, cohort health views, message response times).
- Gather qualitative feedback via in-app survey triggered after key flows (lesson completion, provider publishing).
- Plan v1.51 backlog capturing enhancements, bug fixes, and optimization opportunities informed by data.
