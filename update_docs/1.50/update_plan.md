# Version 1.50 Update Plan

## Analysis Summary
- **Feature Alignment:** The feature brief and update roadmap introduce Cloudflare R2 asset delivery, PowerPoint and ebook workflows, social following, profile components, Communities 2.0, and an Explorer powered by Meilisearch. These demand end-to-end enablement across backend, frontend, mobile, and data layers to deliver unified learner, instructor, and administrator experiences.
- **Issue Remediation:** Pre-update evaluations highlight critical gaps—missing backend domains, weak security defaults, absent dependency governance, immature database schema, mock-driven UIs, and placeholder mobile apps. Fix suggestions emphasise formal API contracts, migrations, tooling, and secure mobile handling, which must be resolved before new capabilities can launch safely.
- **Integrated Strategy:** The plan below sequences foundational hardening before vertical feature builds, ensures cross-platform parity (web, Flutter user app, future provider app), and embeds QA, analytics, documentation, and release management to satisfy Version 1.50 objectives.

## Risk & Dependency Highlights
- Sequencing foundational hardening (Task 1) before feature delivery is mandatory to avoid compounding security and data issues.
- Tasks 2–5 depend on shared API contracts, migrations, and telemetry from Task 1; cross-team syncs must validate readiness at each integration gate.
- Tasks 6–7 require upstream tasks to supply testable builds, documentation inputs, and release artefacts; allocate QA and mobile engineering resources early to parallelise validation.

## Testing & Quality Strategy
- Embed automated pipelines (CI/CD) per task, including contract tests between backend and clients, mobile device farm runs, and design review checkpoints.
- Maintain a shared defect backlog prioritised by severity/feature impact, with weekly steering committee oversight.
- Ensure accessibility, localisation, and compliance testing is performed before beta exit to meet enterprise commitments.
