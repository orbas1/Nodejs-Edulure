# Version 1.50 – New Feature Brief

## Executive Summary
Version 1.50 elevates Edulure to an enterprise-ready learning platform with unified experiences across web and mobile. This release focuses on shoring up compliance, completing unfinished flows, and introducing creation, community, and monetisation capabilities demanded by institutional clients. We are simultaneously hardening the stack (security, infrastructure, integrations) and polishing user experiences so that the product can be deployed immediately after launch without remediation work.

## Strategic Objectives
1. **Enterprise-grade readiness** – deliver hardened infrastructure, secure data handling, complete role/permission models, and regulator-aligned payment flows on both web and phone apps.
2. **Creation and community excellence** – unveil a creation studio that empowers instructors to build courses, e-books, and communities with modular templates while ensuring downstream dashboards are fully operational.
3. **Deep ecosystem integrations** – connect CRM, collaboration, storage, and AI partners (HubSpot, Salesforce, Slack, Google Drive, OpenAI, Claude, Grok) with fine-grained enable/disable controls and BYO key support.
4. **Unified experience layer** – align UX/UI across platforms, reinforce live feeds, messaging, notifications, and ensure every navigation menu leads to functioning sections with no placeholder logic remaining.
5. **Compliance, trust, and transparency** – embed GDPR-compliant data governance, consent workflows, financial information management, policies (T&C, Privacy, Cookies, Refund), and visible scam/fraud protections across touchpoints.
6. **Operational excellence** – guarantee production-readiness through automated tests, observability, database seeding, runbooks, and documentation so launch can occur without remediation or hotfixes.

## Feature Themes & Scope (Web Application)
### 1. Platform Hardening & Infrastructure
- **Enterprise-level upgrade** delivering scalability guardrails, audit trails, automated security scans, and instant production readiness.
- **Environment simplification** with a curated `.env` schema, documentation of hard-coded safe defaults, and a distributable `.env.example` file to accelerate onboarding.
- **Security posture uplift** covering backend plaintext exposure remediation, antivirus/anti-malware integrations, phishing/scam warnings, and strict data-protection policy enforcement.
- **Full test coverage** including unit, integration, E2E, and logic validation runs before release.
- **Operational tooling** providing incident response playbooks, uptime dashboards, health checks, and automated backup validation to satisfy “instant release” confidence.

### 2. Application Architecture & Logic Completion
- **Back-end ↔ Front-end coherence** with typed APIs, error/latency handling, and comprehensive DTO validation.
- **Role & permission enforcement** mapped to administrator, instructor, learner, and community moderator personas; includes route guards, component-level gating, and audit logging.
- **Modularised codebases** for both frontend and backend, aligning shared contracts, feature flags, and CI workflows.
- **Gap closure** across all stubbed logic, ensuring every feature and dashboard module is production functional.
- **Logic flow finalisation** ensuring onboarding, payments, content publishing, ads placement, community management, and support escalations are end-to-end resilient with recovery paths documented.

### 3. Integrations & Automation
- **CRM & collaboration**: bidirectional sync with HubSpot/Salesforce (contacts, deal stages, course enrolments) and Slack notifications for workflow events.
- **Content & storage**: Google Drive file picker, automated course asset ingestion, and backup pipelines.
- **AI enablement**: pluggable services for OpenAI, Anthropic Claude, and XAI Grok with per-tenant toggles, usage metering, and user-provided keys for advanced authoring and learner support features.
- **Notification mesh**: unify Firebase, email, in-app, and Slack channels to guarantee consistent delivery across web, mobile, and partner systems.

### 4. Payments, Finance & Compliance
- **Payment flow finalisation** including PSP integrations, chargeback handling, refunds, and wallet safeguards that comply with non-FCA status (no custodial balances).
- **Financial information management** dashboards for admins and learners, covering invoices, payouts, and tax documents.
- **Policies & governance**: About Us, Terms & Conditions, Privacy Policy, Cookies banner, Refund Policy all accessible and version-controlled.
- **GDPR alignment** with DSR tooling, consent logs, and documented retention schedules.
- **Auditability**: produce reconciliation reports, configurable fraud thresholds, and SAR (suspicious activity report) pipelines to meet enterprise compliance checks.

### 5. Creation Studio & Content Ecosystem
- **Creation Studio launch**: a guided workspace enabling creation of courses, e-books, and communities via configurable templates, asset libraries, and AI-assisted builders.
- **Course management suite** with curriculum designer, assessments, scheduling, and review/rating capture.
- **Community and social graph**: follower relationships, community memberships, community feeds, and Edulure Ads placements.
- **Ads & monetisation**: campaign manager with targeting, placements, analytics, and compliance checks.
- **Content governance**: moderation queues, community guidelines acknowledgement, and safe-publishing workflows that integrate with scam/fraud detection.

### 6. Experience & Interface Enhancement
- **UI/UX overhaul** delivering refreshed colour systems, typography, responsive layouts, and accessible components.
- **Navigation clarity** across headers, footers, dashboards, and contextual menus with iconography (vector assets) aligned to new design language.
- **Dashboards completion** for learners, instructors, and administrators including live feed, notifications, messaging, settings, and ranking/matching algorithms.
- **Onsite communication upgrades**: messaging centre, chat bubbles, notifications, Firebase push setup, and scam warnings.
- **Globalisation readiness**: multi-language toggle, localisation of policies and transactional content, and right-to-left layout support where required.

## Feature Themes & Scope (Phone Flutter Application)
1. **Enterprise parity** – ensure key flows mirror web functionality while keeping mobile-first simplicity, including social logins, payments, financial data, and policy pages.
2. **Configurable environment** – implement an adjustable base API URL with stable endpoint paths for staging/production testing.
3. **Security & compliance** – GDPR-compliant consent, secure storage of credentials, wallet restrictions, and reduced app footprint.
4. **UX/UI modernisation** – refreshed theme, optimised screen/widget hierarchy, vector assets, and accessible navigation.
5. **Functional completion** – integrate live feeds, messaging, notifications (Firebase), app menus, and logic for all existing placeholders.
6. **Documentation & onboarding** – up-to-date README and setup guides for developers and QA.
7. **Parity governance** – cross-platform release checklist confirming that every feature designated for mobile parity has matching analytics, permissions, and support coverage.

## Dependencies & Cross-Cutting Considerations
- Shared authentication and permission layers must expose consistent roles to both platforms.
- Integrations require secrets management updates; align with `.env` reduction strategy while safeguarding sensitive credentials in infrastructure tooling.
- Testing mandate: automated suites for backend, frontend, mobile, plus manual acceptance scripts to validate enterprise readiness.
- Data migrations and seeders must populate taxonomies, templates, policies, and sample assets for QA.
- Security operations require vulnerability management tooling, quarterly pen-test scheduling, and KPIs for scam warning click-through and fraud prevention efficacy.
- Customer success and marketing need enablement kits (FAQs, pitch decks, collateral) derived from new features to ensure post-launch adoption.

## Definition of Done
- All enumerated features implemented, documented, tested, and deployed to a staging environment mirroring production.
- Security, compliance, and data governance sign-offs completed with evidence stored.
- No placeholder text, stubs, or incomplete navigation remains; dashboards and communities are fully operable.
- Release documentation (README, setup guide, update index) refreshed to match the 1.50 feature set.
- Production readiness checklist signed, including observability dashboards, playbooks, rollback drills, and runbook walkthroughs with support and operations teams.
