# Version 1.50 Update Brief

## Executive Overview
Version 1.50 concentrates on hardening the Edulure platform and delivering the next wave of learner, instructor, and mobile capabilities. The programme is structured around seven cross-functional tasks covering infrastructure governance, Cloudflare R2-backed content delivery, social graph foundations, Communities 2.0 monetisation, a Meilisearch-powered Explorer, comprehensive release readiness, and final mile mobile completion. All streams are currently in planning, with measurable progress limited to Task 6 documentation (testing plan publication) while security, integration, functionality, error-free, production, and overall readiness metrics for other tasks remain at 0% in the progress tracker. Delivery sequencing enforces foundational upgrades before feature releases and culminates with mobile store launch support to ensure parity across web, Flutter user, and provider experiences.

## Objectives & Success Criteria
- **Platform Integrity:** Close pre-update security and reliability gaps by completing Task 1 subtasks (1.1–1.5), yielding enforce
d configuration validation, formal API contracts, dependency governance, migration tooling, and orchestration services that unlock
downstream features.
- **Learning Content Excellence:** Implement Task 2 subtasks to move asset delivery to Cloudflare R2, stand up PowerPoint and ebook workflows, and launch analytics-compliant viewers across web and mobile.
- **Social & Community Growth:** Execute Tasks 3 and 4 to introduce follow graphs, modular profiles, revamped communities, chat, affiliate monetisation, and parity across user/provider applications.
- **Discovery & Release Confidence:** Fulfil Task 5 Meilisearch explorer requirements alongside Task 6 QA, documentation, and release management activities to protect production reliability and knowledge transfer.
- **Mobile Readiness:** Deliver Task 7 outcomes covering feature parity closure, performance optimisation, store compliance, device certification, and support playbooks so that the Flutter user and provider apps launch in lockstep with the web experience.
- **Quality Benchmarks:** Raise each task’s progress metrics from the current 0% baselines to 100% by milestone exit, ensuring security, integration, functionality, error-free, production, and overall thresholds are met before release.

## Scope & Deliverables
- **Foundational Hardening (Task 1):** Harden backend services, finalise API contracts shared with web/mobile, establish dependency audits, enable database migrations and monitoring, and create orchestration services for feeds/notifications.
- **Cloudflare R2 & Content Pipelines (Task 2):** Configure R2 infrastructure, build conversion workers, upgrade ebook and deck experiences, provide offline-capable mobile viewers, and emit analytics plus compliance artefacts.
- **Social Graph & Profiles (Task 3):** Launch relationship/privacy schemas, feed aggregation, reusable profile components, cross-platform social UX, and recommendation analytics dashboards.
- **Communities 2.0 & Monetisation (Task 4):** Deliver enhanced community schemas, engagement modules, chat upgrades, affiliate/paywall flows, and unified web/mobile/provider interfaces.
- **Explorer & Search Platform (Task 5):** Deploy Meilisearch, construct ingestion pipelines, build explorer interfaces across platforms, and configure ranking experiments and insight analytics.
- **QA, Documentation & Release (Task 6):** Run full regression, performance, security, and accessibility testing; operate beta feedback loops; publish documentation and enablement packs; coordinate release/change control; and stand up monitoring/on-call practices plus the final update report.
- **Mobile Application Completion (Task 7):** Close feature parity gaps, tune performance/offline behaviour, compile store submission assets, certify devices, and prepare support operations for learner and provider apps.

## Milestone Alignment
- **Milestone 1 – Platform Foundations Locked (Week 4):** Completes Task 1 and unlocks secure, governed infrastructure required by all other milestones.
- **Milestone 2 – Cloud-Native Content Delivery (Week 8):** Delivers Task 2, relying on Milestone 1 governance and enabling deck/ebook experiences.
- **Milestone 3 – Social Graph & Profile System (Week 10):** Executes Task 3 features using services and assets from Milestones 1–2.
- **Milestone 4 – Communities 2.0 & Monetisation Launch (Week 13):** Implements Task 4 modules, dependent on social data and design assets established earlier.
- **Milestone 5 – Explorer & Release Readiness (Week 16):** Concludes Task 5 search delivery and Task 6 release assurance to prep for go-live.
- **Milestone 6 – Mobile Application Completion & Store Launch (Week 18):** Finalises Task 7, aligning store submissions, support, and mobile analytics with the broader release.

## Testing & Quality Strategy
- Publish the Version 1.10 testing plan (testing_plan.md) as the QA charter guiding coverage, ownership, and exit criteria across all tasks.
- Embed automated unit, integration, load, security, and accessibility suites per Task 6.1 to protect against regressions as new services roll out.
- Run staged beta programmes (Task 6.2) covering web and mobile clients, collecting telemetry and user surveys to guide defect burndown.
- Maintain documentation, training, and release artefacts (Task 6.3–6.5) to ensure stakeholders, support, and operations teams are prepared for go-live and post-launch monitoring.
- Extend mobile-specific QA through Task 7.4 to certify performance, accessibility, and stability across the targeted device matrix before store submissions.

## Dependencies & Risks
- Downstream tasks (2–7) rely on Task 1’s security, API, and database baselines; gating reviews are required before workstream handoffs.
- Tasks 2–5 must coordinate data contracts, analytics schemas, and design tokens to avoid rework and ensure consistent cross-platform UX.
- Milestones 5–6 require timely delivery of documentation, test evidence, and store assets; delays in earlier feature builds may compress QA and release windows.
- Maintain contingency via feature flags, rollback scripts, and phased rollout plans, especially for monetisation and mobile store launches.

## Current Status & Next Steps
- All tasks and subtasks are in planning; only Task 6 documentation shows initial movement (testing plan publication) while remaining metrics stay at 0%, as tracked in the progress tracker tables.
- Immediate next steps include finalising Task 1 security baseline implementation, validating API specifications with frontend/mobile teams, incorporating the new testing plan into squad backlogs, and scheduling milestone readiness reviews to confirm execution start.
- Parallel preparation work should gather required compliance documentation, localisation inputs, and design assets to accelerate Tasks 2–7 once foundations are certified.
