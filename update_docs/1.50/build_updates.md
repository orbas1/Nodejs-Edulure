# Build & Tooling Updates – Version 1.50 Task 2

- `backend-nodejs`: `npm install` executed to capture AWS SDK/CloudConvert dependencies; `npm run lint` passes with new services.
- `frontend-reactjs`: `npm install`, `npm run lint`, and `npm run build` executed to validate new content library code paths and ensure Vite bundle health (chunk-size warning acknowledged).
- `Edulure-Flutter`: `flutter pub get` required to resolve Dio/Hive/open_filex dependencies – tooling unavailable in container so action deferred to CI/local developer environments.
