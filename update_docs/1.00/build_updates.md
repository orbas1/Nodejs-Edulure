# Build & Deployment Updates – Version 1.00

- Introduced production-grade Dockerfiles for the backend and operator web app plus an Nginx health configuration, enabling deterministic image builds with pnpm caching, runtime healthchecks, and BuildKit-ready multi-stage pipelines. 【F:infrastructure/docker/Dockerfile.backend†L1-L45】【F:infrastructure/docker/Dockerfile.frontend†L1-L22】【F:infrastructure/docker/nginx.conf†L1-L16】
- Added a root `docker-compose.yml` and `scripts/bootstrap-environment.sh` helper that build images, run migrations/seeds, and validate Terraform workspaces, giving engineers a repeatable parity check across local, dev, staging, and production. 【F:docker-compose.yml†L1-L38】【F:scripts/bootstrap-environment.sh†L1-L44】
- Checked in an `infrastructure/environment-manifest.json` describing expected Terraform/Docker hashes so the backend parity service can detect drift during `/environment/health` evaluations. 【F:infrastructure/environment-manifest.json†L1-L38】
- Introduced an `environment-parity` GitHub workflow that validates Terraform modules, lints IaC with TFLint, builds reference Docker images, and runs Trivy/ShellCheck so parity checks are enforced in CI. 【F:.github/workflows/environment-parity.yml†L1-L74】
- Added dependency-governance and SLSA provenance GitHub workflows that execute npm audit, license reporting, SBOM generation, Trivy, Scorecard checks, and signed release attestations to keep supply-chain automation enforced in CI/CD. 【F:.github/workflows/dependency-governance.yml†L1-L95】【F:.github/workflows/slsa-provenance.yml†L1-L20】
