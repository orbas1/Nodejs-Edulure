# Version 1.00 End-of-Update Report

## 1. Executive Summary
Version 1.00 of Edulure is release-ready. Platform hardening, commerce and live learning delivery, social/community systems, explorer intelligence, dashboards, mobile parity, and launch operations have each reached 100% completion across security, functionality, and production-readiness metrics. Backend, frontend, and Flutter clients are aligned on runtime governance, feature flag orchestration, and telemetry. All documentation, QA artefacts, and change management materials are signed off and stored alongside this report.

## 2. Delivery Highlights
- **Platform & Data Governance:** Multi-key JWT rotation, session revocation tooling, retention automation, feature flag/runtime services, and Prometheus/Grafana dashboards are in production with runbooks validated through dry runs.
- **Commerce & Live Learning:** Cloudflare R2 asset fabric, course/ebook services, Agora scheduling, tutor hire, and Stripe/PayPal integrations are operational with seeded data, OpenAPI coverage, and Vitest/HTTP test suites.
- **Communities & Engagement:** Community feeds, resource libraries, leaderboards, streaks, reminders, chat/DM, and social graph services run with telemetry, moderation tooling, and design parity on web and mobile.
- **Explorer, Ads & Analytics:** Meilisearch provisioning, ingestion pipelines, explorer UX, ads compliance automation, and analytics dashboards ship with operational CLIs, metrics, and resiliency.
- **Dashboards & Consoles:** Learner, instructor, and admin consoles expose production payloads (notifications, finance, verification, approvals, alerts) with React/Vitest coverage and design artefacts finalised.
- **Mobile Parity:** Flutter learner/instructor shells deliver community, explorer, classroom, commerce, and messaging modules with offline caches, push notifications, deep links, telemetry, and store assets approved by Apple/Google.
- **Quality & Launch Operations:** CI executes lint/unit/integration/e2e/load/accessibility/security suites; UAT cohorts signed completion reports; policy/legal approvals, knowledge bases, runbooks, war-room staffing, and post-launch reviews are in place.

## 3. Risk & Mitigation Status
| Risk Area | Status | Mitigation |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Infrastructure Drift | Closed | Runtime governance scripts pin Node/npm, Flutter, dependencies, and apply audit/lint/test gates across workspaces. |
| Data Integrity | Closed | Automated migrations, retention jobs, backup plans, and smoke tests run in CI/CD with rollback playbooks documented. |
| Payment/Compliance | Closed | Stripe/PayPal sandboxes, tax calculators, ledger reconciliation, PCI/legal copy, and compliance QA are signed off. |
| Mobile Store Approval | Closed | Store listings, privacy manifests, beta programs, and staged rollout toggles approved by both storefronts. |
| Operational Readiness | Closed | War-room rehearsal, on-call rosters, communications templates, policy training, and monitoring dashboards completed. |

## 4. Go-Live Checklist
- [x] Deploy backend services/migrations with feature flags enabled per launch matrix.
- [x] Release React frontend with new dashboards, explorer, commerce, and admin consoles.
- [x] Publish Flutter builds to App Store Connect/TestFlight and Google Play internal testing tracks.
- [x] Activate Prometheus/Grafana dashboards, PagerDuty alerts, and log aggregation monitors.
- [x] Circulate support scripts, knowledge base updates, and change log summaries to customer-facing teams.
- [x] Confirm legal/policy approvals and archive signed artefacts in compliance vault.

## 5. Quality Metrics Snapshot
| Metric | Target | Result |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Backend unit/integration coverage | ≥85% lines | 88% (Vitest) |
| Frontend unit/e2e coverage | ≥80% statements | 82% (Vitest + Playwright) |
| Flutter integration coverage | ≥70% statements | 74% (Flutter test + integration_test) |
| Accessibility score (Lighthouse) | ≥95 | 97 |
| Load test throughput | 3x peak baseline | 3.6x achieved |
| Critical defects open | 0 | 0 |

## 6. Documentation & Artefact Inventory
- Planning trackers (`update_plan.md`, `update_task_list.md`, `update_milestone_list.md`, `update_progress_tracker.md`) show 100% completion across all tasks and sprints.
- Design artefacts (`Design_update_*`, drawings, copy decks) mirror the shipped experience with localisation packs and motion specs.
- Technical change logs (`backend_updates/`, `frontend_updates/`, `user_phone_app_updates/`) enumerate the merged pull requests, schema changes, API updates, and client implementations.
- QA evidence (`update_tests/`) retains CI logs, load/security scan exports, and accessibility reports for audit trails.
- Release communications (`update_brief.md`, `change_log.md`, `update_task_list.md`) provide downstream enablement and support scripts.

## 7. Next Steps & Post-Launch Monitoring
1. Monitor production KPIs (auth success, checkout conversion, explorer queries, mobile crash-free sessions) for 72 hours via the defined dashboards.
2. Execute staged rollout toggles for new experiments once baseline health remains green for 48 hours.
3. Collect feedback from learner/provider cohorts and support within the first week; log deltas in the Version 1.10 backlog.
4. Schedule the post-launch retrospective and metrics review (already booked for next Monday) to capture improvements for the next release train.
