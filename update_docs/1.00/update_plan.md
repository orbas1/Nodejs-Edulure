# Update Plan â€“ Version 1.00

## Executive summary
Version 1.00 focuses on turning the Edulure platform into a production-ready offering. We will stabilise unfinished backend workflows, harden the data layer, and unblock the promised operator and mobile experiences described in the new feature brief. In parallel, we will close the critical issues catalogued in the pre-update issue report and issue list, delivering the fix suggestions through a sequenced plan that emphasises security, observability, and stakeholder enablement. The scope spans backend, web, mobile, analytics, infrastructure, and organisational alignment to ensure Version 1.00 satisfies customer, compliance, and go-to-market expectations.

## Objectives
1. Replace mocked or disabled services with fully integrated, monitored backend, data, and third-party workflows.
2. Ship a trustworthy operator experience with secure storage, localisation, accessibility, and embedded support tooling.
3. Provide a defined provider strategy and a stable learner mobile companion with hardened security and telemetry.
4. Industrialise infrastructure, release management, security, and compliance operations to match enterprise commitments.
5. Deliver analytics, monetisation, documentation, and enablement assets that reflect the true product surface.

## Scope mapping
- **New feature coverage**: Implement feature flag governance, realtime collaboration, offline mobile workflows, provider enablement, analytics dashboards, and capability matrices promised in the new feature brief and features-to-add documentation.
- **Issue remediation**: Address all items in the issue list and report, prioritising backend stability, data governance, dependency hygiene, mobile gaps, security/compliance deficits, infrastructure drift, QA/test automation, analytics paralysis, and organisational misalignment.
- **Fix suggestion alignment**: Each plan task references the fix suggestions, ensuring remediation work is bundled with the enabling features and quality controls.

## High-level approach
1. **Stabilise the core services**: Audit backend controllers, schedulers, queues, feature flags, and integrations; rebuild migrations and seeds; encrypt sensitive data; and stand up monitoring, DLQs, and contract tests.
2. **Modernise the operator experience**: Replace mock data with live SDK clients, complete validation/error handling, implement accessibility/localisation/security guardrails, and expose support tooling behind RBAC controls.
3. **Reintroduce mobile and provider value**: Publish provider migration guides, define interim workflows, restore integrations, and harden the learner Flutter app with live services, offline support, secure storage, instrumentation, and mobile CI/CD.
4. **Operationalise the platform**: Consolidate IaC, enforce environment parity, build automated pipelines (Renovate, SBOM, scans), implement release readiness gates, and institutionalise observability, incident response, and compliance programmes.
5. **Empower analytics and stakeholders**: Deliver telemetry pipelines, governed warehouses, BI assets, monetisation mechanics, documentation refreshes, and cross-functional enablement tied to risk/governance frameworks.

## Deliverables
- Updated backend services, queues, feature flags, integrations, and data governance artefacts with automated validation.
- Production-ready web operator experience covering Executive Overview, Learning Operations, Provider Relations, Compliance & Risk, Revenue & Finance, and Support dashboards with accessibility/localisation compliance, secure token handling, and embedded support tooling across every page and modal.
- Provider transition pack, responsive fallback workflows, and hardened learner mobile application with monitoring and release automation.
- Unified infrastructure templates, automated pipelines for dependencies and security, release checklists, observability stack, and compliance evidence flows.
- Analytics warehouse and dashboards (executive scorecards, learner progress, provider performance, finance reconciliations, experimentation insights), monetisation and contract governance tooling, refreshed documentation, enablement assets, and capability matrices.
- Comprehensive test suites (unit, integration, contract, end-to-end, load, accessibility, localisation, security) with scripted manual QA packs and reporting.
- Updated changelog, end-of-update report, and update brief packages.

## Out of scope
- Net-new product verticals outside the commitments already marketed (e.g., unrelated AI experiments).
- Major architectural rewrites beyond what is required to stabilise existing services.
- Decommissioning of legacy partner integrations not referenced in current contracts (will be handled in future updates after stakeholder review).

## Risks and mitigations
| Risk | Impact | Mitigation |
|------|--------|------------|
| Legacy mock implementations mask missing business logic until late testing | Critical features fail during release readiness | Pair contract/integration tests with service hardening; schedule mid-sprint demos with QA to confirm behaviour |
| Third-party providers throttle or break during integration | Payment, media, messaging, or compliance workflows fail | Introduce sandbox abstractions, retries, circuit breakers, DLQs, and contract monitoring early in Milestone 1 |
| Environment drift blocks reproducibility | QA results invalidated, deployments fail | Containerise bootstrap scripts, enforce IaC plan/apply via CI policy checks, and gate releases on parity audits |
| Accessibility/security remediation slips | Enterprise deals delayed, compliance exposure | Track accessibility/security defects as release blockers with weekly audits and automated Lighthouse/axe/SAST pipelines |
| Provider transition lacks stakeholder sign-off | Field operations confusion, contractual risk | Run cross-functional reviews and publish migration comms before cutting over provider workflows |
| Analytics warehouse seeding delays dashboards | Leadership lacks insight for go-live | Stage synthetic datasets early, parallelise ETL setup with service instrumentation, and gate Milestone 4 on validated dashboards |

## Testing strategy
- **Automated**: Unit, integration, contract, end-to-end (web/mobile), load, accessibility (axe/Lighthouse), localisation, security (SAST/DAST), mobile widget/golden tests, Terraform plan validation, policy-as-code.
- **Manual**: Scripted regression packs per persona (operator, learner, provider support), chaos drills, blue/green failovers, accessibility audits with assistive tech, mobile device lab runs.
- **Reporting**: Daily CI dashboards, release readiness scorecards, defect burndown charts, and post-test executive summaries feeding the update_progress_tracker.

## Documentation & communications
- Update onboarding, API docs, support playbooks, training curricula, marketing collateral, capability matrix, and changelog.
- Publish provider transition guides, release notes, and stakeholder briefings aligned with milestones.
- Maintain Update Plan, milestone list, task list, progress tracker, test plan, and end-of-update report, ensuring Version 1.50 planning inherits accurate context.

## Website UI and dashboard scope
- **Operator dashboards**: Rebuild the Executive Overview (KPIs, alerts, health), Learning Operations (curriculum, cohorts, assignments), Provider Relations (attendance, compliance, payouts), Compliance & Risk (audits, incidents, SOC/ISO controls), Revenue & Finance (subscriptions, usage-based billing, reconciliations), and Support & Communications (tickets, announcements, chat) surfaces with live data and responsive layouts.
- **Primary web pages**: Complete authentication, onboarding wizard, tenant switcher, course catalogue, learner management, provider management, analytics library, experimentation lab, billing centre, knowledge base, settings, and notification centre routes with localisation, accessibility, and state management.
- **Shared screens and flows**: Implement reusable modals, drawers, multi-step forms, timeline/activity feeds, empty/error/loading states, in-app guidance, and embedded dashboards for LMS/SCORM contexts, ensuring parity across desktop, tablet, and mobile breakpoints.
- **Design system alignment**: Establish design tokens, theming, component documentation, and visual regression baselines so dashboards, pages, and screens remain consistent with marketing commitments and future Version 1.50 enhancements.

## Success criteria
- All issues in the pre-update list resolved or documented with approved deferrals.
- Feature parity with the commitments in the new feature brief demonstrated in staging with signed-off acceptance tests.
- Security, accessibility, and compliance audits pass with evidence captured.
- Provider and learner experiences validated via pilot cohorts with crash rate, retention, and satisfaction improvements.
- Analytics dashboards deliver verified metrics for leadership, finance reconciliations match Stripe/PayPal ledgers, and documentation is current.
