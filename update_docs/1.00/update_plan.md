# Version 1.00 Update Plan – Edulure Full Ecosystem Launch

## Analysis Summary
- **Feature Alignment:** Version 1.00 combines every capability listed in the Edulure Full Functions charter into a single release: General area commerce, Communities 2.0, dashboards for learners and instructors, Explorer search, Edulure Ads, communications, policy governance, and Flutter parity. Delivering these experiences requires coordinated upgrades to storage, payments, live classrooms, analytics, and design systems across web, backend, and mobile clients.
- **Issue Remediation:** Pre-update evaluations highlight missing backend domains, weak security, poor dependency governance, immature database design, mock-driven UIs, and placeholder Flutter flows. Fix suggestions require hardened API contracts, structured migrations, dependency controls, mobile security, and real data integrations before new features reach production.
- **Integrated Strategy:** The plan prioritises platform hardening, then layers content commerce, social communities, discovery, dashboards, mobile parity, and QA. Each task below includes integration coverage for Backend, Front-end, User Phone App, Provider Phone App, Database, API, Logic, and Design, plus 4–6 subtasks with measurable outputs. Percent complete reflects current readiness heading into Version 1.00 execution.
