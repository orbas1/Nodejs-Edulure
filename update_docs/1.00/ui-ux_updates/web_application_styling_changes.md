# Web Application Styling Updates â€“ Version 1.00

- Reworked the operator dashboard hero, card grid, and table styling to accommodate the new executive overview. Cards now use consistent 24px border radii, semantic colour palettes for severity badges, and responsive grid breakpoints to keep KPI density readable on 1280px and 1024px viewports.
- Added offline and stale-state banners with high-contrast amber/rose palettes, iconography, and WCAG-compliant focus outlines so operators immediately understand when cached data is being displayed.
- Tuned the service health and incident lists to use accessible padding, typography hierarchy, and hover states that align with the broader dashboard shell while maintaining screen-reader friendly semantics.
