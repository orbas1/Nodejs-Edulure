# Dashboard Organisation & Layout

## Grid Layout
- Two-column layout on desktop: primary column (8 units) for charts and lists, secondary column (4 units) for tasks and insights.
- On tablet, stack charts followed by lists; on mobile, vertical stacking with sticky filter bar.

## Widget Hierarchy
1. Metrics hero row
2. Trends chart
3. Community performance
4. Asset performance
5. Tasks & alerts
6. Resource spotlight (release notes, best practices)

## Navigation
- Tab bar at top toggling between "Overview", "Communities", "Assets", "Monetisation".
- Each tab loads context-specific widgets while maintaining filter state.

## Filters & Controls
- Filter toolbar includes timeframe dropdown, segment dropdown (course/community), search input.
- Provide "Compare" toggle to display previous period data overlay on charts.

## Accessibility & Responsiveness
- Ensure charts have textual summaries.
- Provide keyboard focus order that respects widget importance.
- Maintain 24px minimum spacing between cards for readability.
