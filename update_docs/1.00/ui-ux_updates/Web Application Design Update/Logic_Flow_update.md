# Logic Flow Updates – Web Application v1.00

## Home Experience Flow
1. User lands on `/home` with audience parameter (default `learner`).
2. System loads hero content and featured modules based on audience.
3. On CTA click, route to either onboarding wizard (`/onboarding`) or resume module (`/learn/:courseId`).
4. Scroll triggers lazy load for testimonials and FAQ sections to reduce initial payload.

## Dashboard Flow
1. Authenticate user and fetch role-specific configuration.
2. Load KPI widgets concurrently with tasks and announcements.
3. After data fetch, initialise WebSocket for real-time updates (insights, notifications).
4. User interactions (filter changes, widget reorder) update URL query params and persist via API.

## Learn Library Flow
1. Load filters and saved preferences.
2. Execute search query with default filter set; results paginated with infinite scroll.
3. Selecting a course stores context for `Course Detail` route and prefetches metadata.

## Course Detail & Lesson Flow
1. Course detail fetch includes modules, prerequisites, and instructor info.
2. Enrol action triggers API call, updates user profile, and navigates to lesson player.
3. Lesson player fetches content chunk, transcript, notes; auto-saves progress every 30 seconds.
4. Completing lesson updates progress bar and triggers recommendation service for next lesson.

## Community Flow
1. Landing on community hub fetches joined communities, trending topics, events.
2. Posting in feed triggers optimistic update and websocket broadcast.
3. Event registration opens modal; upon confirm, adds to calendar and sends confirmation email.

## Settings Flow
1. Accessing settings loads overview summary first, then lazy-loads other tabs on demand.
2. Form submissions auto-save; major changes require confirmation modals.
3. Security tab verifies MFA status and prompts setup if missing.

## Error & Offline Handling
- Global error boundary redirects to friendly error page with retry.
- Offline detection displays banner and queues actions until reconnection.

## Analytics Events
- Emit events for hero CTA, filter changes, module reorder, course enrol, lesson complete, community post, event register, settings update.
- Attach metadata: user role, plan tier, locale.

## Communities & Profile Flow Extensions
- From Dashboard tasks referencing community events, open targeted community detail with context `?ref=taskId` to highlight relevant post.
- Community join state triggers server call `POST /api/communities/:id/join`; on success add community to sidebar pinned list and show toast.
- Profile edits propagate to dashboard hero and community badges via event `profile:update` to ensure UI sync without reload.

## Support & Escalation Flow
1. Settings → Support link routes to `/support` with `context` query (e.g., `billing`, `technical`).
2. Support screen preselects FAQ tab matching context.
3. Ticket form submission generates case ID; websockets push status updates to `Support` screen and notifications bell.
4. Escalated tickets notify admin analytics to surface in `Support overview` widget.

## Admin Oversight Flow
1. Admin detection occurs post-auth using role claim; admin header adds `Admin` segment.
2. `Admin Analytics` loads; filter updates propagate to `Admin Content` via shared store to align metrics and course lists.
3. Content updates (publish/archive) emit `content:update` event consumed by Learn Library to refresh listings.

## Error & Offline Enhancements
- When API fails repeatedly (3 attempts) display service status banner linking to status page.
- Offline queue handles notes, support tickets, playlist adjustments; show reconnection toast once synced.

## Accessibility Flow Hooks
- Each modal sets focus to first interactive element and restores on close.
- Reduced motion toggles stored in user preferences; when enabled, skip parallax sequences and replace with fade transitions.
