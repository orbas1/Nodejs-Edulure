# Component Organisation & Placement

## Navigation
- Primary navigation left-aligned on desktop, icon rail collapsed on tablet/mobile.
- Secondary navigation (tabs) sits below page header.
- Quick action button anchored to top right (Create, Notifications, Profile).

## Content Modules
- Place high priority content above the fold: resume, hero metrics, alerts.
- Provide consistent margins between modules (24px desktop, 16px mobile).
- Use anchored anchor links for long pages (Profile, Settings).

## Utility Elements
- Feedback button in persistent footer.
- Support chat bubble bottom-right; collapses when notifications open.

## Responsiveness
- At <768px, move navigation into bottom tab bar for learners; providers get hamburger with overlay menu.
- Cards become full-width with horizontal scroll for carousels.
