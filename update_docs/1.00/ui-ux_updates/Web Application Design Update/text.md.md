# Text & Microcopy Guidelines

## Voice & Tone
- **Confident & Supportive:** Provide direct guidance with positive reinforcement, e.g., "You're set—your deck is processing".
- **Inclusive Language:** Avoid gendered references; focus on actions and impact ("Invite collaborators" vs. "Add guys").
- **Action-Oriented:** Use verbs in button copy and success states ("Publish Course", "View Analytics").

## Content Patterns
- **Headlines:** Short, impact-driven; highlight benefit ("Grow Your Community", "Pick up where you left off").
- **Body Copy:** 2–3 sentences maximum per block; use bullet lists for complex instructions.
- **Tooltips:** Provide single-sentence clarifications with references to documentation when necessary.
- **Empty States:** Combine 1-line headline, 1-sentence description, and prominent CTA or import option.

## Accessibility & Localisation
- Avoid idioms; ensure text can be translated without losing meaning.
- Provide alt text for all imagery referencing actions ("Screenshot of analytics dashboard showing daily signups").
- Maintain string keys in translation files referencing screen + component to ease localisation.

## Writing for Notifications
- **Success:** "Course published—view preview".
- **Info:** "Analytics refreshing…this may take a minute".
- **Warning:** "Storage nearing limit—review asset usage".
- **Error:** "Upload failed—check file format and try again".

## Formatting Rules
- Use sentence case for labels and button text.
- Use Oxford comma in lists for clarity.
- Numbers below 10 spelled out in narrative text, digits for data metrics.
