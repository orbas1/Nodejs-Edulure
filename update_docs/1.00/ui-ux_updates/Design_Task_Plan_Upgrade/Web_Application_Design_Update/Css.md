# CSS

- Utilise CSS variables for tokens (`--color-primary`, `--font-heading`).
- Grid/flex utilities manage layout; prefer CSS grid for dashboards.
- Use prefers-reduced-motion media queries to disable heavy animations.
- Include support for dark/light theme toggles via class switching.
- Ensure modular BEM naming for custom components to avoid conflicts.
