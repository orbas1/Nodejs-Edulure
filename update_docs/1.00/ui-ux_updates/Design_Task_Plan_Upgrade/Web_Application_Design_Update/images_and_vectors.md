# Images and Vectors

- Use 3D illustration library emphasising collaboration and global reach.
- Icons align with linear style at 2px stroke; use consistent corner radius.
- Provide fallback PNGs for browsers without SVG support.
- Create vector backgrounds for hero and community banners.
- Ensure assets optimised for R2 distribution with responsive sizes.
