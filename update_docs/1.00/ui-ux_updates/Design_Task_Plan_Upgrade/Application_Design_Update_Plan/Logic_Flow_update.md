# Logic Flow Update â€” Mobile Application v1.00

## Objectives
- Align navigation logic across learner and provider apps to reduce redundant routes.
- Ensure system-level states (offline, maintenance, compliance) gracefully interrupt flows without data loss.
- Document event triggers for analytics, notifications, and background tasks.

## Core Flow Changes
1. **Unified Entry Handler:** Replace separate onboarding vs. login checks with single `AppLaunch` state machine evaluating auth token, profile completeness, and forced-update flags.
2. **Contextual Deep Linking:** All notifications now pass `contextType` and `contextId`; router resolves to target screen and scrolls to relevant widget (e.g., comment, quiz result).
3. **State Preservation:** Implement route guard storing last visited tab and scroll offset; resume exactly where user left off after modal/drawer interactions.
4. **Role-Based Navigation:** Use capability matrix to toggle provider features. Switching roles (for hybrid users) triggers soft reload and updates nav structure without app restart.
5. **Error Boundary Routing:** Introduce intermediate "Recovery" screen capturing error details and offering retry/support options; prevents abrupt app exits.
6. **Background Sync Scheduler:** Lesson downloads, upload retries, and analytics refresh run via background tasks triggered every 30 minutes when on Wi-Fi and charging.

## Conditional Branches
- **Offline:** Redirects API-dependent actions to offline queue; present fallback screens (Downloads, Saved posts).
- **Compliance Blocks (Provider):** If `complianceStatus = blocked`, display blocking modal with checklist; only Settings and Support remain accessible until resolved.
- **Subscription Gates:** Learners hitting premium content view paywall sheet; upon purchase, refresh context and return to requested screen.

## Event & Telemetry Mapping
| Event | Trigger | Payload |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `navigation_tab_switch` | Bottom nav selection | `{tabId, previousTabId, role}` |
| `lesson_complete` | Lesson progress reaches 100% | `{courseId, lessonId, timeSpent}` |
| `upload_step_completed` | Provider wizard step success | `{stepNumber, assetType, duration}` |
| `community_post_published` | Composer submit | `{threadId, hasAttachment, sentiment}` |
| `setting_toggle_changed` | Setting toggled | `{settingId, value, source}` |

## Security Considerations
- Validate deep-link intents before navigation to avoid spoofing.
- Use encrypted storage for cached tokens and downloads metadata.
- Audit log of admin actions available in provider settings.

## Next Actions
- Collaborate with engineering to implement state machine in Flutter/React Native codebase.
- Create flow diagrams (Mermaid) for complex sequences and attach to `Screens_Update_Logic_Flow_map.md`.
- Schedule QA scenarios focusing on offline transitions and compliance locks.
