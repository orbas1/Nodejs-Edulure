# Logic Flow Update

## Objectives
- Ensure each primary task (upload, schedule, discover, manage followers) has clear entry points and minimal context switching.
- Align flows with backend readiness: asynchronous operations use optimistic UI updates with error recovery and retry.
- Introduce offline-aware branches so users can continue critical actions even with unstable connectivity.

## Key Flow Enhancements
### 1. Provider Media Publishing
1. Dashboard quick action launches upload sheet with recent templates.
2. File validation occurs locally; upon success, async upload begins with conversion status tracker.
3. User can add metadata while conversion runs; autosave ensures progress persists.
4. Publish confirmation summarises distribution targets (courses, communities) and recommended follow-up tasks.
5. Background worker notifies via push and in-app inbox when conversion completes or fails.

### 2. Learner Resume & Discovery
1. Home feed hero surfaces "Continue Learning" module with most recent asset.
2. Selecting asset checks cached state; if stale, fetches delta updates before launching viewer.
3. Within viewer, persistent bottom sheet offers related discussions and recommended next asset.
4. Exiting viewer triggers progress sync and surfaces share/reflection prompt.

### 3. Community Engagement & Moderation
1. Notification or dashboard card opens community hub to relevant channel.
2. Moderation tools appear contextually (swipe, long-press) with confirmation modals.
3. Escalations route to admin view, capturing audit trail and providing templated responses.

### 4. Settings & Personalisation
1. User taps avatar â†’ Settings; quick toggles for appearance and notifications available at top.
2. Deeper configuration (privacy, integrations) accessible via segmented tabs or accordion sections.
3. Save actions produce inline toasts and sync status indicator for multi-device propagation.

## Error & Edge Case Handling
- Provide offline fallback screens with ability to queue uploads and flag unsynced actions.
- Retry strategy with exponential backoff for API operations; show countdown timers for next attempt.
- Centralised error reporting via support sheet enabling screenshot and log attachment.
