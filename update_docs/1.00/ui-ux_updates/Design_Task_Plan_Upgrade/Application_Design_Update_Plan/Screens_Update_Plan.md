# Screens Update Plan

| Phase | Screens | Key Activities | Dependencies | Outcomes |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Sprint 1 | Navigation Shell, Provider Dashboard (PD-01) | Produce measurable grid specs, blueprint ASCII, and component bill-of-materials (BOM). Annotate states for header, KPI cards, quick action tray. | Updated design tokens, persona journeys. | Signed "coded layout" package with density tokens and motion timings. |
| Sprint 2 | Media Library (PD-02), Upload Flow | Draft card variants, bulk action mechanics, and version drawer diagrams. Deliver widget code notes (props, state machines) and REST payload schemas. | Conversion pipeline API mocks, offline storage rules. | Redlines + JSON schema attachments accepted by engineering. |
| Sprint 3 | Learner Home (LR-01), Media Viewer (LR-02) | Detail carousel physics, annotation rail hit zones, and discussion drawer overlays. Provide interaction matrices for gesture vs. tap behaviour. | Behavioural analytics events, haptics guidelines. | Interactive prototype validated by 10 learners with telemetry instrumentation list. |
| Sprint 4 | Community Hub, Events, Messaging | Lay out channel lists, message bubbles, and moderator tooling with component slots for badges, reactions, and pins. Document push notification entry points to each state. | Real-time messaging SDK updates, moderation policy inputs. | Usability-tested flows with moderators and learners, ready-to-build state charts. |
| Sprint 5 | Settings, Profile & Goals, Support Surfaces | Map settings hierarchy with component tables for toggles, sliders, chips. Provide accessibility overlay specs (focus order, reading order, voice labels). | Notification service mapping, identity API. | Complete content inventory, localisation-ready copy, focus order diagrams. |
| Sprint 6 | Cross-Screen Polish | Align interactions, motion, and global search; deliver final asset manifest and widget-to-code traceability checklist. | QA schedule, analytics instrumentation plan. | Sign-off package with QA checklist, Zeplin links, and component tokens locked. |

## Milestones
1. **Blueprint Sign-Off:** ASCII layout maps, component BOM, and spacing matrix approved by product/engineering.
2. **Design System Lock:** Tokens, typography, and components finalised with widget code references.
3. **Prototype Validation:** Conduct remote tests with at least 10 learners/providers each using instrumented prototype builds.
4. **Accessibility Review:** Pass WCAG 2.2 AA evaluation with documented remediations and focus order charts.
5. **Engineering Handoff:** Annotated specs (Figma, Zeplin, JSON props) uploaded with acceptance criteria and component traceability IDs.
