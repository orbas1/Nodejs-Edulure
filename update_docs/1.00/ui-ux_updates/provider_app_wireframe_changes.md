# Provider App Wireframe Changes

## Dashboard
- **Hero Analytics Strip:** First row displays revenue, active communities, and course completion velocity with spark-lines; each widget expands into detail modals.
- **Action Shelf:** Quick actions for "Upload Deck", "Create Community Event", and "Review Follow Requests" anchored directly under analytics.
- **Notifications Drawer:** Right-edge drawer summarises moderation alerts, affiliate payouts, and storage usage anomalies sourced from R2 telemetry.

## Course & Media Management
- **Asset Library Grid:** Three-tab structure (PowerPoints, Ebooks, Media) with card previews, sync status badges, and bulk action checkboxes.
- **Upload Flow:** Stepper showing validation → conversion → publish; inline tips describe file requirements and migration progress from legacy storage.
- **Version Timeline:** Each asset card expands to reveal conversion history, signed URL logs, and quick rollback actions.

## Community Operations
- **Community Switcher:** Left panel lists owned/moderated communities with tier badges; selecting one updates the main canvas.
- **Community Hub Layout:** Hero banner, announcements rail, feed filters, leaderboard widget, and event calendar mirror Communities 2.0 web design for parity.
- **Affiliate Marketplace Panel:** Tab surfaces referral offers, commission sliders, and withdrawal status chips for each community.

## Explorer & Follows
- **Follow Suggestions Card:** Highlights learners/instructors with shared topics; includes mutual community badges and quick follow buttons.
- **Search Entry:** Docked search with filter chips (People, Courses, Communities, Assets) leading into the global explorer module.
- **Insights Snapshot:** Shows conversion metrics per follow suggestion to help providers gauge content resonance.

## Settings & Compliance
- **Privacy Checklist:** Sectioned accordion covering follower privacy, community moderation defaults, and DRM controls for ebooks.
- **Notification Matrix:** Grid aligning events (follows, payouts, chat, incidents) with delivery channels (push, email, in-app).
- **Audit Log Feed:** Chronological table referencing admin console for escalations, ensuring providers can trace role changes or paywall edits.
