# Version 1.00 Design Update Progress Tracker

| Metric | Current Score (%) | Status Commentary |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Design Quality | 68 | High-fidelity templates for home and dashboards are drafted, but media viewer states need refinement and peer review. |
| Design Organisation | 72 | Updated IA documentation and component inventory exist; dependencies between Flutter and web specs still require tighter linking. |
| Design Position | 64 | Key hero and campaign placements mapped, yet seasonal takeover logic for landing pages awaits marketing alignment. |
| Design Text Grade | 70 | Copy decks cover primary surfaces; compliance copy for consent and monetisation pending final legal sign-off. |
| Design Colour Grade | 75 | Token palettes validated for contrast; emo/seasonal overlays partially tested and need regression automation. |
| Design Render Grade | 62 | Rendering fidelity within Figma is strong, but cross-platform render tests have surfaced spacing inconsistencies. |
| Compliance Grade | 66 | Privacy and security overlays drafted; data retention notes for annotations still open. |
| Security Grade | 60 | Consent and notification flows documented, however secure defaults for new settings toggles require engineering confirmation. |
| Design Functionality Grade | 63 | Interaction specs address primary use cases; advanced motion and offline states are still under definition. |
| Design Images Grade | 58 | Asset manifests are incomplete and seasonal imagery placeholders must be replaced with final art direction. |
| Design Usability Grade | 69 | Initial usability sessions positive on navigation, but further testing needed on settings and monetisation flows. |
| Bugs-Less Grade | 65 | QA reviews have flagged inconsistencies in dark-mode icons and spacing; fixes in progress. |
| Test Grade | 61 | Automated visual regression harness configured, yet coverage for Flutter components is limited. |
| QA Grade | 67 | QA checklist drafted; requires alignment with localisation and accessibility teams for full coverage. |
| Design Accuracy Grade | 70 | Most components align with tokens; a few legacy screens still reference deprecated styles awaiting updates. |
| Overall Grade | 66 | Solid foundational progress with clear gaps around imagery, motion, and compliance integration that must close before handoff. |

## Progress Notes
- Navigation blueprints and responsive grids validated across breakpoints, but card spacing parity between React and Flutter remains open.
- Emo theme implementation plan drafted; regression suite to be automated alongside engineering ingestion of token JSON exports.
- Accessibility audits scheduled for Week 6 in alignment with Milestone 4; early feedback emphasises clearer focus states on media controls.
- Imagery backlog review with marketing scheduled next sprint to confirm seasonal asset pipeline and animation briefs.
