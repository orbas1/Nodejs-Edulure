# Version 1.50 Design Progress Tracker

## Snapshot
Design work has progressed from discovery into detailing for the content pipeline. Research artefacts are nearly half complete, the design system freeze is accelerating, and feature-level detailing for media viewers and content dashboards is approaching handoff quality. Scores below reflect the refreshed artefacts, outstanding risks, and validation coverage.

### Metric Overview (0–100%)
| Workstream | Design Quality | Design Organisation | Design Position | Design Text Grade | Design Colour Grade | Design Render Grade | Compliance Grade | Security Grade | Design Functionality Grade | Design Images Grade | Design Usability Grade | Bugs-less Grade | Test Grade | QA Grade | Design Accuracy Grade | Overall Grade |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Application Experience (Flutter) | 78 | 74 | 72 | 75 | 76 | 70 | 68 | 65 | 74 | 72 | 68 | 62 | 55 | 52 | 73 | 70 |
| Web Application Experience | 80 | 76 | 74 | 78 | 82 | 72 | 70 | 66 | 76 | 74 | 70 | 64 | 56 | 54 | 75 | 72 |
| Shared Design System & Governance | 82 | 84 | 80 | 78 | 85 | 74 | 72 | 72 | 78 | 76 | 72 | 66 | 58 | 56 | 80 | 76 |

### Interpretation
- **Design Quality:** High-level compositions are coherent, but finalised redlines and interaction states are pending, lowering confidence.
- **Design Organisation & Position:** Information architecture is mostly defined, yet edge-case flows (e.g., affiliate escalations) still need mapping.
- **Text & Colour Grades:** Copy and token workstreams are progressing; compliance/legal copy is not signed off, keeping grades below 75.
- **Render & Functionality Grades:** High-fidelity renders exist for priority screens, but dynamic states and responsive breakpoints remain incomplete.
- **Compliance & Security:** Settings and moderation flows lack final review, keeping compliance/security awareness at or below 60.
- **Usability & Bugs-less Grades:** Early usability tests uncovered navigation hesitations and readability concerns; mitigation backlog remains open.
- **Test & QA Grades:** Formal accessibility, localisation, and design QA cycles are scheduled for Milestone 4; hence grades remain below 50.
- **Design Accuracy:** Cross-platform parity is improving, but parity gaps across Flutter/web components keep accuracy under 70.

## Milestone Progress Alignment
| Milestone | Target Week | Current Completion | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Milestone 1 – Discovery & Alignment Complete | Week 2 | 45% | Majority of interviews complete; analytics requirements and decision log still in progress. |
| Milestone 2 – Cross-Platform Design System Frozen | Week 4 | 60% | Token audit updated with media viewer tokens; accessibility baseline expanded to cover dark/light ebook states, motion guidance final draft underway. |
| Milestone 3 – Feature Surface Detailing | Week 6 | 55% | High-fidelity frames approved for home/dashboard and media viewers; explorer and settings flows in final review. |
| Milestone 4 – Design QA & Engineering Handoff | Week 8 | 25% | QA resourcing secured, accessibility and localisation checklists drafted, awaiting explorer sign-off for packaging. |

## Task Progress Highlights
- Research & Experience Alignment: 45% – usability sessions nearly complete; telemetry mapping pending final approval.
- Cross-Platform Design System Consolidation: 55% – tokens/component kits updated for content viewers, accessibility documentation covering dark/light modes, and governance cadences ratified.
- Application Experience Detailing: 60% – navigation, home, and mobile content library workflows documented with offline/downloading states.
- Web Experience Detailing: 55% – navigation, homepage, and content analytics layouts validated; explorer/settings variants in final review.
- Design QA & Engineering Handoff: 25% – audit checklist prepared, localisation and instrumentation packs drafted, dry-run QA scheduled alongside engineering.

## Next Steps
1. Close outstanding analytics and telemetry requirements to solidify Milestone 1 exit criteria.
2. Finalise component-level motion specs and responsive breakpoints to complete the design system freeze.
3. Complete explorer, Communities 2.0, and settings detailing to unlock the remaining engineering handoffs.
4. Execute accessibility and localisation QA dry runs aligned with the newly drafted checklists before Milestone 4.
