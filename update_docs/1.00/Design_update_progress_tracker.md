# Version 1.00 Design Update Progress Tracker

| Metric | Current Score (%) | Status Commentary |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Design Quality | 82 | Community hub and resource sidebar specifications now mirror `dashboard_drawings.md`, `website_drawings.md`, and `App_screens_drawings.md`, layering role badges, pagination controls, and accessibility cues over the existing commerce suite. |
| Design Organisation | 76 | Updated IA overlays connect community switching, feed detail, and resource curation to finance/admin flows using `menu_drawings.md`, `Admin_panel_drawings.md`, and `Design_Task_Plan_Upgrade/Web_Application_Design_Update/Web Application Design Update.md`. |
| Design Position | 70 | Layout guidance balances hero metrics, feed cards, and resource drawers across breakpoints, with spacing and hierarchy validated against `dashboard_drawings.md` and `menu_drawings.md`. |
| Design Text Grade | 70 | Copy decks now cover community moderation prompts, resource pagination helper text, and role-based guardrails referencing `Screen_text.md` and `Application_Design_Update_Plan/Application Design Update.md`. |
| Design Colour Grade | 74 | Engagement/status tokens extended to payment state badges, dispute severity markers, community visibility chips, and resource metadata tags while preserving WCAG ratios. |
| Design Render Grade | 68 | High-fidelity renders complete for checkout modals, community profile summaries, resource drawers, and notification badges ready for engineering handoff. |
| Compliance Grade | 75 | PCI/legal overlays remain intact while private community access copy and escalation prompts map to `Admin_panel_drawings.md` and compliance runbooks. |
| Security Grade | 84 | Payment surfaces and community access shells display SCA state indicators, membership guards, and secure data notices mirroring backend enforcement. |
| Design Functionality Grade | 74 | Interaction diagrams now capture community switching, feed refresh, resource pagination, coupon enforcement, and webhook retries to keep cross-domain workflows in sync. |
| Design Images Grade | 68 | Asset manifests expanded with community emblems, role badges, and resource thumbnails ensuring parity across learner/provider experiences. |
| Design Usability Grade | 70 | Usability walkthroughs validated community switching, feed loading, checkout, SCA handling, and moderation heuristics with learner/provider stakeholders. |
| Bugs-Less Grade | 62 | Peer reviews resolved finance banner stacking issues, webhook timeline scroll clipping, and community drawer spacing; motion polish for micro-interactions remains logged. |
| Test Grade | 66 | Regression scripts now target checkout modals, resource pagination states, feed loader fallbacks, and webhook alert rules across device classes. |
| QA Grade | 70 | QA checklist expanded with coupon governance edge cases, resource pagination QA, moderation prompts, and webhook replay acceptance criteria. |
| Design Accuracy Grade | 72 | Measurements validated for finance summary rails, community profile cards, resource drawers, and webhook feed cards across responsive breakpoints. |
| Overall Grade | 77 | Commerce and community surfaces achieve production readiness with comprehensive specifications, accessibility coverage, and compliance annotations while motion polish continues in the next sprint. |

## Progress Notes
- Token and theming workstreams remain stable, enabling downstream template production and runtime validation.
- Navigation, layout, and component templates now include live classroom lobbies, tutor storefronts, moderation consoles, and the refreshed community hub overlays alongside storage governance flows.
- Compliance, security, and QA disciplines are engaged; recording consent, ticketing, payout readiness, moderation prompts, and private community guardrails mirror backend enforcement while accessibility and localisation checks continue.
- Checkout, refund, dispute, and finance dashboards now mirror backend `/api/payments` contracts with SCA handoffs, webhook fallbacks, coupon governance, ledger export guidance, and dispute resolution overlays captured in `web_application_logic_flow_changes.md`, `provider_app_wireframe_changes.md`, `user_app_wireframe_changes.md`, and `Application_Design_Update_Plan/Application Design Update.md`. Community hub overlays follow the same governance and accessibility notes outlined in `dashboard_drawings.md`, `website_drawings.md`, and `App_screens_drawings.md`.
