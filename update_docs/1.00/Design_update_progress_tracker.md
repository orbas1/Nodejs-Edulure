# Version 1.00 Design Update Progress Tracker

| Metric | Current Score (%) | Status Commentary |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Design Quality | 78 | Live classroom and commerce checkout specs are annotated across `dashboard_drawings.md`, `website_drawings.md`, and `App_screens_drawings.md`, covering payment, refund, and receipt states alongside booking flows. |
| Design Organisation | 74 | Information architecture threads tutor rosters, classroom calendars, and the new payments IA (checkout, receipts, admin finance) using `menu_drawings.md` and `Organisation_and_positions.md`. |
| Design Position | 70 | Layout guidance balances video stage, roster drawers, commerce summary rails, and legal disclosure panels without breaking breakpoints documented in `Screen Size Changes.md`. |
| Design Text Grade | 70 | Copy decks now cover payment confirmation, dispute escalation, VAT invoicing, and refund timelines referencing `Screen_text.md` and `text.md.md` with localisation buffers. |
| Design Colour Grade | 75 | Commerce badges and payment method tiles extend engagement tokens while preserving WCAG ratios noted in `Screen_update_Screen_colours.md`. |
| Design Render Grade | 64 | High-fidelity renders complete for checkout steps, payment success/failure overlays, and finance dashboards alongside live classroom scenes. |
| Compliance Grade | 76 | Ticketing, payout, PCI copy, and refund consent prompts validated with legal/security partners referencing `Admin_panel_drawings.md`. |
| Security Grade | 84 | Join and checkout experiences surface verification indicators, secure payment notices, and webhook health banners aligned with backend enforcement. |
| Design Functionality Grade | 70 | Interaction diagrams cover booking conflicts, waitlists, coupon/tax application, payment retries, and moderator escalation flows. |
| Design Images Grade | 66 | Asset manifests expanded with payment method illustrations, finance icons, and tutor photography per `images_and_vectors.md`. |
| Design Usability Grade | 66 | Usability walkthroughs validated scheduling heuristics, checkout form completion, and refund requests across learner/provider cohorts. |
| Bugs-Less Grade | 56 | Peer reviews resolved layout regressions for checkout summary rails and calendar overlays; outstanding motion polish logged. |
| Test Grade | 62 | Regression scripts now target booking calendars, checkout validation, and chat overlays across desktop/tablet/mobile breakpoints. |
| QA Grade | 64 | QA checklist updated with tutor onboarding, live session moderation, Stripe/PayPal smoke tests, and webhook monitoring. |
| Design Accuracy Grade | 66 | Measurements for agenda rails, roster drawers, order recap cards, and attendee chips validated across device matrices. |
| Overall Grade | 74 | Live classroom and commerce experiences reach production readiness with cohesive scheduling, billing, and compliance treatments; motion polish remains planned. |

## Progress Notes
- Token and theming workstreams remain stable, enabling downstream template production and runtime validation.
- Navigation, layout, and component templates now include live classroom lobbies, tutor storefronts, moderation consoles, and learner checkout/finance consoles alongside storage governance flows.
- Compliance, security, and QA disciplines are engaged; recording consent, ticketing, payout readiness, commerce disclosures, and moderation prompts mirror backend enforcement while accessibility and localisation checks continue.
