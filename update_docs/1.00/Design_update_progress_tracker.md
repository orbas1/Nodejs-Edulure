# Version 1.00 Design Update Progress Tracker

| Metric | Current Score (%) | Status Commentary |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Design Quality | 64 | Token documentation aligns across platforms; verification messaging polished for onboarding flows. |
| Design Organisation | 60 | IA restructure drafted; telemetry overlays now map UI modules to observability dashboards for ongoing validation. |
| Design Position | 55 | Homepage hero and campaign placements validated on desktop/tablet; mobile stacking rules still under review. |
| Design Text Grade | 56 | Core microcopy approved; verification and payment disclosures signed-off with legal. |
| Design Colour Grade | 72 | Palette sets validated for default, emo, and seasonal themes; need final QA on partial theme overrides. |
| Design Render Grade | 40 | High-fidelity renders produced for home/dashboards; explorer and media viewer renders in progress. |
| Compliance Grade | 60 | Privacy prompts, consent overlays, and verification disclosures now align with security governance. |
| Security Grade | 66 | Verification UX, lockout messaging, session governance flows (active device listings, revoke prompts), and runtime copy approved; data retention notices queued for next sprint. |
| Design Functionality Grade | 46 | Interaction specs outlined for navigation/forms and telemetry touchpoints documented; motion tiers not yet prototyped. |
| Design Images Grade | 50 | Imagery specs documented; emo/festive asset pack sourcing underway with marketing. |
| Design Usability Grade | 45 | Two rounds of internal walkthroughs complete; session logout confirmations cleared with support, external validation scheduled. |
| Bugs-Less Grade | 40 | QA reviews cleared verification copy issues; remaining token regressions queued. |
| Test Grade | 44 | Visual regression and accessibility scripts run alongside new observability dashboards to flag latency/error regressions. |
| QA Grade | 48 | QA checklist now references Prometheus/trace dashboards during design sign-off, supplementing verification scenarios. |
| Design Accuracy Grade | 50 | Component measurements align with tokens; Flutter parity adjustments outstanding for charts. |
| Overall Grade | 55 | Security copy closed; telemetry-aligned QA boosts readiness while imagery, motion, and automation remain priority focus. |

## Progress Notes
- Token and theming workstreams are leading, enabling downstream template production and runtime validation.
- Navigation, layout, and component templates are mid-flight; prioritising explorer/media surfaces and mobile stacking refinements.
- Compliance, security, and QA disciplines are engaged; verification messaging now mirrors backend enforcement, session governance overlays are scripted for settings dashboards, and observability dashboards feed design QA while data retention notes and accessibility scripts progress toward closure.
