# Version 1.00 Design Update Progress Tracker

| Metric | Current Score (%) | Status Commentary |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Design Quality | 74 | Tutor storefronts, booking flows, and live classroom consoles are specified for web, admin, and learner clients referencing `dashboard_drawings.md` and `App_screens_drawings.md`. |
| Design Organisation | 70 | Information architecture now threads tutor rosters, classroom calendars, and escalation pathways using `menu_drawings.md` and `website_drawings.md`. |
| Design Position | 66 | Layout guidance balances video stage, roster drawers, chat panels, and booking sidebars without breaking breakpoints. |
| Design Text Grade | 66 | Copy decks cover tutor bios, cancellation guardrails, recording consent, and Agora connectivity states with localisation buffers. |
| Design Colour Grade | 74 | Engagement/status tokens extended to availability pills, stream badges, and moderation alerts while preserving WCAG ratios. |
| Design Render Grade | 58 | High-fidelity renders complete for lobby countdowns, in-session chat, tutor onboarding, and payout dashboards. |
| Compliance Grade | 70 | Ticketing, moderation, and payout policies documented with references to `Admin_panel_drawings.md` and legal copy reviews. |
| Security Grade | 82 | Join experiences surface verification indicators, host controls, and secure token notices aligned with backend enforcement. |
| Design Functionality Grade | 64 | Interaction diagrams include booking conflict checks, waitlists, seat limit adjustments, and moderator escalation flows. |
| Design Images Grade | 62 | Asset manifests expanded with tutor photography, classroom illustrations, and accessibility-compliant iconography. |
| Design Usability Grade | 60 | Usability walkthroughs validated scheduling heuristics, countdown timers, and post-class surveys with mixed learner/provider cohorts. |
| Bugs-Less Grade | 52 | Peer reviews resolved stacking regressions for calendar overlays and stream controls; outstanding motion polish logged. |
| Test Grade | 58 | Regression scripts now target booking calendars, lobby states, and chat overlays across desktop/tablet/mobile breakpoints. |
| QA Grade | 60 | QA checklist updated with tutor onboarding, live session moderation, and Agora token smoke scenarios. |
| Design Accuracy Grade | 62 | Measurements for agenda rails, roster drawers, and attendee chips validated across device matrices. |
| Overall Grade | 69 | Live learning/tutor flows meet production readiness while planned motion refinements continue in the next sprint. |

## Progress Notes
- Token and theming workstreams remain stable, enabling downstream template production and runtime validation.
- Navigation, layout, and component templates now include live classroom lobbies, tutor storefronts, and moderation consoles alongside storage governance flows.
- Compliance, security, and QA disciplines are engaged; recording consent, ticketing, payout readiness, and moderation prompts mirror backend enforcement while accessibility and localisation checks continue.
