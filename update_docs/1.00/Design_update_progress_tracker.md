| Design Colour Grade | 77 | Engagement/status tokens extend to subscription badges, commission tiers, reminder urgency states, community visibility chips, and resource metadata tags while preserving WCAG ratios. |
| Design Render Grade | 76 | High-fidelity renders complete for checkout modals, tier comparison views, affiliate dashboards, engagement leaderboards, streak badges, event calendars, and notification badges ready for engineering handoff. |
| Compliance Grade | 80 | PCI/legal overlays include payout tax prompts, affiliate disclosures, reminder consent messaging, and private community access copy mapped to `Admin_panel_drawings.md` and compliance runbooks. |
| Security Grade | 86 | Payment surfaces, community access shells, and engagement reminders display SCA states, membership guards, secure payout notices, and opt-in confirmations mirroring backend enforcement. |
| Design Functionality Grade | 84 | Interaction diagrams capture community switching, paywall enrolment, subscription lifecycle, affiliate approval, leaderboard filtering, streak rollovers, RSVP flows, and reminder opt-ins to keep cross-domain workflows in sync. |
| Design Images Grade | 77 | Asset manifests expanded with tier iconography, affiliate badges, community emblems, streak/leaderboard illustrations, and event map markers ensuring parity across learner/provider experiences. |
| Design Usability Grade | 78 | Usability walkthroughs validated community switching, tier selection, leaderboard filtering, streak progress prompts, RSVP flows, checkout, payout workflows, and moderation heuristics with learner/provider cohorts. |
| Bugs-Less Grade | 70 | Peer review resolved finance banner stacking, webhook timeline scroll clipping, community drawer spacing, affiliate leaderboard truncation, and engagement badge overflow; motion polish remains logged. |
| Test Grade | 74 | Regression scripts target checkout modals, tier eligibility, affiliate ledgers, leaderboard sorting, streak resets, resource pagination, and reminder triggers across device classes. |
| QA Grade | 78 | QA checklist now covers coupon governance, paywall enrolment, affiliate payouts, engagement reminder consent, moderation prompts, and webhook replay acceptance criteria. |
| Design Accuracy Grade | 80 | Measurements validated for finance summary rails, tier comparison decks, leaderboard tables, streak badges, event calendar grids, community profile cards, and resource drawers across responsive breakpoints. |
| Overall Grade | 84 | Commerce and engagement surfaces achieve production readiness with monetisation, accessibility, and compliance annotations validated; remaining work focuses on animation polish and experimentation tooling. |

## Progress Notes
- Token and theming workstreams remain stable, enabling downstream template production and runtime validation.
- Navigation, layout, and component templates now include live classroom lobbies, tutor storefronts, moderation consoles, monetised community landing stacks, engagement leaderboards/streak dashboards, and affiliate finance consoles alongside storage governance flows.
- Compliance, security, and QA disciplines are engaged; recording consent, ticketing, payout readiness, paywall disclosures, reminder consent, moderation prompts, and private community guardrails mirror backend enforcement while accessibility and localisation checks continue.
- Checkout, refund, dispute, subscription, affiliate finance, and engagement dashboards now mirror backend `/api/payments`, `/api/communities/paywall`, and `/api/communities/engagement` contracts with SCA handoffs, webhook fallbacks, coupon governance, leaderboard filters, reminder governance, ledger export guidance, and dispute resolution overlays captured in `web_application_logic_flow_changes.md`, `provider_app_wireframe_changes.md`, `user_app_wireframe_changes.md`, `Application_Design_Update_Plan/Application Design Update.md`, `dashboard_drawings.md`, `website_drawings.md`, `App_screens_drawings.md`, and `Admin_panel_drawings.md`.
