## Progress Notes
- Token and theming workstreams remain stable, enabling downstream template production and runtime validation.
- Explorer intelligence dashboard frames incorporate KPI tiles, range toggles, refresh buttons, forecast cards, query spotlights, and alert bands referencing `Dashboard Designs.md`, `Screen_update_Screen_colours.md`, `dashboard_drawings.md`, `website_drawings.md`, and `App_screens_drawings.md`, aligning the `/analytics` build with SCR-11 specifications.
- Navigation, layout, and component templates now include live classroom lobbies, tutor storefronts, moderation consoles, monetised community landing stacks, engagement leaderboards/streak dashboards, affiliate finance consoles, community chat docks, DM inbox/thread panes, follower/following management trays, recommendation carousels, and privacy settings alongside storage governance flows.
- Compliance, security, and QA disciplines are engaged; recording consent, ticketing, payout readiness, paywall disclosures, reminder consent, moderation prompts, private community guardrails, chat/DND disclosures, DM retention/export notices, follow privacy copy, mute/block confirmations, and recommendation rationale messaging mirror backend enforcement while accessibility and localisation checks continue.
- Checkout, refund, dispute, subscription, affiliate finance, engagement dashboards, messaging overlays, and social graph experiences now mirror backend `/api/payments`, `/api/communities/paywall`, `/api/communities/engagement`, `/api/communities/{id}/chat`, `/api/chat/threads`, and `/api/social` contracts with SCA handoffs, webhook fallbacks, coupon governance, leaderboard filters, reminder governance, chat pagination, presence TTL references, ledger export guidance, DM quiet hours, follower pagination, recommendation metadata, mute/block confirmations, and dispute resolution overlays captured in `web_application_logic_flow_changes.md`, `provider_app_wireframe_changes.md`, `user_app_wireframe_changes.md`, `Application_Design_Update_Plan/Application Design Update.md`, `dashboard_drawings.md`, `website_drawings.md`, `App_screens_drawings.md`, `Admin_panel_drawings.md`, and `menu_drawings.md`.
- Explorer and ads intelligence surfaces now have production-ready specs: mixed-entity search tabs, facet drawers, saved search management,
  topojson map interactions, promoted ad tiles, zero-result education, SRE health consoles, and ingestion telemetry (progress bars, retry prompts, freshness badges) reference `website_drawings.md`, `dashboard_drawings.md`,
  `menu_drawings.md`, `Admin_panel_drawings.md`, `App_screens_drawings.md`, and `ui-ux_updates/Design_Task_Plan_Upgrade/Web_Application_Design_Update/Function Design.md`, aligning UX cues with Meilisearch ranking rules, synonyms, Prometheus metrics, and the new ingestion workflow.
- Ads governance overlays now mirror backend automation: compliance banners surface spend breaches, auto-pause toasts, review task drawers, and insight drill-down charts using `dashboard_drawings.md`, `website_drawings.md`, `Admin_panel_drawings.md`, and `App_screens_drawings.md`, keeping instructor dashboards and admin consoles aligned with AdsService enforcement.
- Learner profile overview artefacts now capture hero metrics, verification badge rails, insight tiles, quick action ribbons, programme shelves, and timeline events with cache refresh cues, localisation copy, analytics IDs, and accessibility annotations mapped to `Profile Look.md`, `Profile Styling.md`, `dashboard_drawings.md`, `App_screens_drawings.md`, and `Admin_panel_drawings.md`, ensuring engineering implementation mirrors production-ready specifications.
