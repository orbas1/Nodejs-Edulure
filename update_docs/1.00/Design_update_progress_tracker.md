# Version 1.00 Design Update Progress Tracker

| Metric | Current Score (%) | Status Commentary |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Design Quality | 90 | Monetised community templates, tier comparison layouts, affiliate payout dashboards, engagement leaderboards, refreshed messaging docks (chat channels + DM inbox), and the new follower/following management trays align to `dashboard_drawings.md`, `website_drawings.md`, and `App_screens_drawings.md`, layering entitlement, moderation, presence, and relationship telemetry anchors. |
| Design Organisation | 82 | Updated IA overlays connect community switching, paywall onboarding, affiliate operations, engagement hubs, messaging trays, follower recommendations, and finance/admin flows using `menu_drawings.md`, `Admin_panel_drawings.md`, and `Design_Task_Plan_Upgrade/Web_Application_Design_Update/Web Application Design Update.md`. |
| Design Position | 80 | Layout guidance now balances hero metrics, tier stacks, leaderboard tables, streak badges, feed cards, resource drawers, chat columns, DM thread panes, follower lists, and recommendation carousels across breakpoints with spacing validated against `dashboard_drawings.md` and `menu_drawings.md`. |
| Design Text Grade | 80 | Copy decks cover community moderation prompts, paywall benefits, affiliate earnings, streak reminders, RSVP confirmations, presence TTL/DND messaging, DM quiet hours, follow approvals, mute/block confirmations, and privacy toggles referencing `Screen_text.md` and `Application_Design_Update_Plan/Application Design Update.md`. |
| Design Colour Grade | 79 | Engagement/status tokens extend to subscription badges, commission tiers, reminder urgency states, community visibility chips, presence beacons, DM mention pills, follower badges, and recommendation accents while preserving WCAG ratios. |
| Design Render Grade | 78 | High-fidelity renders complete for checkout modals, tier comparison views, affiliate dashboards, engagement leaderboards, streak badges, event calendars, notification badges, chat drawers, DM threads, and follower/following management panels ready for engineering handoff. |
| Compliance Grade | 82 | PCI/legal overlays include payout tax prompts, affiliate disclosures, reminder consent messaging, private community access copy, DM export notices, follow privacy disclosures, mute/block confirmation copy, and chat moderation disclaimers mapped to `Admin_panel_drawings.md` and compliance runbooks. |
| Security Grade | 87 | Payment surfaces, community access shells, engagement reminders, chat moderation drawers, DM security prompts, and social privacy toggles display SCA states, membership guards, safe attachment messaging, and relationship governance notices mirroring backend enforcement. |
| Design Functionality Grade | 86 | Interaction diagrams capture community switching, paywall enrolment, subscription lifecycle, affiliate approval, leaderboard filtering, streak rollovers, RSVP flows, reminder opt-ins, chat threading, reaction handling, DM read receipts, follower requests/approvals, recommendation consumption, and mute/block management to keep cross-domain workflows in sync. |
| Design Images Grade | 79 | Asset manifests expanded with tier iconography, affiliate badges, community emblems, streak/leaderboard illustrations, event map markers, channel avatars, presence glyphs, DM attachment previews, and follower/recommendation artwork ensuring parity across learner/provider experiences. |
| Design Usability Grade | 80 | Usability walkthroughs validated community switching, tier selection, leaderboard filtering, streak progress prompts, RSVP flows, checkout, payout workflows, chat moderation heuristics, DM inbox triage, follower approvals, and privacy toggles with learner/provider cohorts. |
| Bugs-Less Grade | 72 | Peer review resolved finance banner stacking, webhook timeline scroll clipping, community drawer spacing, affiliate leaderboard truncation, engagement badge overflow, chat dock focus cycling, DM badge truncation, and follower list tab focus order; motion polish remains logged. |
| Test Grade | 76 | Regression scripts target checkout modals, tier eligibility, affiliate ledgers, leaderboard sorting, streak resets, resource pagination, reminder triggers, chat pagination, DM attachment handling, presence refresh cadence, follower pagination, and recommendation dismissal across device classes. |
| QA Grade | 80 | QA checklist now covers coupon governance, paywall enrolment, affiliate payouts, engagement reminder consent, moderation prompts, webhook replay acceptance, chat safety tooling, DM retention/export review, follow approvals, mute/block governance, and privacy setting updates. |
| Design Accuracy Grade | 82 | Measurements validated for finance summary rails, tier comparison decks, leaderboard tables, streak badges, event calendar grids, community profile cards, chat columns, DM list rows, follower list rows, recommendation cards, and reaction trays across responsive breakpoints. |
| Overall Grade | 86 | Commerce, engagement, messaging, and social graph surfaces achieve production readiness with monetisation, accessibility, security, and compliance annotations validated; remaining work focuses on animation polish and experimentation tooling. |

## Progress Notes
- Token and theming workstreams remain stable, enabling downstream template production and runtime validation.
- Navigation, layout, and component templates now include live classroom lobbies, tutor storefronts, moderation consoles, monetised community landing stacks, engagement leaderboards/streak dashboards, affiliate finance consoles, community chat docks, DM inbox/thread panes, follower/following management trays, recommendation carousels, and privacy settings alongside storage governance flows.
- Compliance, security, and QA disciplines are engaged; recording consent, ticketing, payout readiness, paywall disclosures, reminder consent, moderation prompts, private community guardrails, chat/DND disclosures, DM retention/export notices, follow privacy copy, mute/block confirmations, and recommendation rationale messaging mirror backend enforcement while accessibility and localisation checks continue.
- Checkout, refund, dispute, subscription, affiliate finance, engagement dashboards, messaging overlays, and social graph experiences now mirror backend `/api/payments`, `/api/communities/paywall`, `/api/communities/engagement`, `/api/communities/{id}/chat`, `/api/chat/threads`, and `/api/social` contracts with SCA handoffs, webhook fallbacks, coupon governance, leaderboard filters, reminder governance, chat pagination, presence TTL references, ledger export guidance, DM quiet hours, follower pagination, recommendation metadata, mute/block confirmations, and dispute resolution overlays captured in `web_application_logic_flow_changes.md`, `provider_app_wireframe_changes.md`, `user_app_wireframe_changes.md`, `Application_Design_Update_Plan/Application Design Update.md`, `dashboard_drawings.md`, `website_drawings.md`, `App_screens_drawings.md`, `Admin_panel_drawings.md`, and `menu_drawings.md`.
