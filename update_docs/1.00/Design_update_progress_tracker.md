| Design Text Grade | 68 | Copy decks now include refund eligibility copy, dispute escalation scripts, SCA instructions, and PayPal fallback messaging with localisation buffers tied to `Screen_text.md`. |
| Design Colour Grade | 74 | Engagement/status tokens extended to payment state badges, dispute severity markers, and webhook alerts while preserving WCAG ratios. |
| Design Render Grade | 64 | High-fidelity renders complete for checkout modals, payment confirmation, refund trackers, finance health overview, and webhook monitors ready for engineering handoff. |
| Compliance Grade | 74 | PCI/legal overlays annotate refund approvals, ledger exports, and dispute escalations referencing `Admin_panel_drawings.md` and compliance runbooks. |
| Security Grade | 84 | Payment surfaces display SCA state indicators, webhook verification badges, and secure data notices mirroring backend enforcement. |
| Design Functionality Grade | 72 | Interaction diagrams capture coupon limit enforcement, partial refunds, webhook retries, dispute lifecycle automation, and finance alert configuration. |
| Design Images Grade | 66 | Asset manifests expanded with finance icons, dispute illustrations, and SCA imagery ensuring parity across learner/provider experiences. |
| Design Usability Grade | 68 | Usability walkthroughs validated checkout, SCA handling, refund submissions, dispute collaboration, and webhook triage heuristics with finance stakeholders. |
| Bugs-Less Grade | 58 | Peer reviews resolved finance banner stacking issues and webhook timeline scroll clipping; motion polish for micro-interactions remains logged. |
| Test Grade | 64 | Regression scripts now target checkout modals, payment confirmation states, refund drawers, webhook alert rules, and dispute kanban updates across device classes. |
| QA Grade | 68 | QA checklist expanded with coupon governance edge cases, refund SLA tracking, dispute evidence uploads, and webhook replay acceptance criteria. |
| Design Accuracy Grade | 70 | Measurements validated for finance summary rails, coupon drawers, SCA modals, dispute kanban columns, and webhook feed cards across responsive breakpoints. |
| Overall Grade | 75 | Commerce and finance surfaces achieve production readiness with comprehensive specifications, accessibility coverage, and compliance annotations while motion polish continues in the next sprint. |

## Progress Notes
- Token and theming workstreams remain stable, enabling downstream template production and runtime validation.
- Navigation, layout, and component templates now include live classroom lobbies, tutor storefronts, and moderation consoles alongside storage governance flows.
- Compliance, security, and QA disciplines are engaged; recording consent, ticketing, payout readiness, and moderation prompts mirror backend enforcement while accessibility and localisation checks continue.
- Checkout, refund, dispute, and finance dashboards now mirror backend `/api/payments` contracts with SCA handoffs, webhook fallbacks, coupon governance, ledger export guidance, and dispute resolution overlays captured across `web_application_logic_flow_changes.md`, `provider_app_wireframe_changes.md`, `user_app_wireframe_changes.md`, and `Application_Design_Update_Plan/Application Design Update.md`.
