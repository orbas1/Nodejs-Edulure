# Version 1.00 Design Update Progress Tracker

| Metric | Current Score (%) | Status Commentary |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Design Quality | 85 | Monetised community templates, tier comparison layouts, and affiliate payout dashboards now align to `dashboard_drawings.md`, `website_drawings.md`, and `App_screens_drawings.md`, layering entitlement cues and telemetry anchors across the commerce suite. |
| Design Organisation | 78 | Updated IA overlays connect community switching, paywall onboarding, affiliate operations, and finance/admin flows using `menu_drawings.md`, `Admin_panel_drawings.md`, and `Design_Task_Plan_Upgrade/Web_Application_Design_Update/Web Application Design Update.md`. |
| Design Position | 74 | Layout guidance balances hero metrics, tier stacks, feed cards, and resource drawers across breakpoints, with spacing and hierarchy validated against `dashboard_drawings.md` and `menu_drawings.md`. |
| Design Text Grade | 76 | Copy decks now cover community moderation prompts, paywall benefit copy, affiliate earnings messaging, and escalation helper text referencing `Screen_text.md` and `Application_Design_Update_Plan/Application Design Update.md`. |
| Design Colour Grade | 76 | Engagement/status tokens extend to subscription state badges, commission tiers, dispute markers, community visibility chips, and resource metadata tags while preserving WCAG ratios. |
| Design Render Grade | 72 | High-fidelity renders complete for checkout modals, tier comparison views, affiliate dashboards, community profile summaries, and notification badges ready for engineering handoff. |
| Compliance Grade | 78 | PCI/legal overlays now include payout tax prompts, affiliate disclosure banners, and private community access copy mapped to `Admin_panel_drawings.md` and compliance runbooks. |
| Security Grade | 86 | Payment surfaces and community access shells display SCA state indicators, membership guards, secure payout notices, and fraud escalation cues mirroring backend enforcement. |
| Design Functionality Grade | 79 | Interaction diagrams capture community switching, paywall enrolment, subscription lifecycle states, affiliate approval, and webhook retries to keep cross-domain workflows in sync. |
| Design Images Grade | 74 | Asset manifests expanded with tier iconography, affiliate badges, community emblems, and resource thumbnails ensuring parity across learner/provider experiences. |
| Design Usability Grade | 74 | Usability walkthroughs validated community switching, tier selection, checkout, payout workflows, and moderation heuristics with learner/provider stakeholders. |
| Bugs-Less Grade | 66 | Peer review resolved finance banner stacking issues, webhook timeline scroll clipping, community drawer spacing, and affiliate leaderboard truncation; motion polish remains logged. |
| Test Grade | 70 | Regression scripts now target checkout modals, tier eligibility states, affiliate ledger exports, resource pagination, and webhook alert rules across device classes. |
| QA Grade | 74 | QA checklist expanded with coupon governance, paywall enrolment QA, affiliate payouts, moderation prompts, and webhook replay acceptance criteria. |
| Design Accuracy Grade | 76 | Measurements validated for finance summary rails, tier comparison decks, community profile cards, resource drawers, and webhook feed cards across responsive breakpoints. |
| Overall Grade | 81 | Commerce and community surfaces achieve production readiness with monetisation, accessibility, and compliance annotations validated; remaining work focuses on animation polish and extended experimentation tooling. |

## Progress Notes
- Token and theming workstreams remain stable, enabling downstream template production and runtime validation.
- Navigation, layout, and component templates now include live classroom lobbies, tutor storefronts, moderation consoles, monetised community landing stacks, and affiliate finance consoles alongside storage governance flows.
- Compliance, security, and QA disciplines are engaged; recording consent, ticketing, payout readiness, paywall disclosures, moderation prompts, and private community guardrails mirror backend enforcement while accessibility and localisation checks continue.
- Checkout, refund, dispute, subscription, and affiliate finance dashboards now mirror backend `/api/payments` and `/api/communities/paywall` contracts with SCA handoffs, webhook fallbacks, coupon governance, ledger export guidance, and dispute resolution overlays captured in `web_application_logic_flow_changes.md`, `provider_app_wireframe_changes.md`, `user_app_wireframe_changes.md`, and `Application_Design_Update_Plan/Application Design Update.md`. Community hub overlays follow the same governance and accessibility notes outlined in `dashboard_drawings.md`, `website_drawings.md`, `App_screens_drawings.md`, and `Admin_panel_drawings.md`.
