# Screen Updates

- Added **ProviderTransitionCenterScreen** with Markdown-rendered briefs, milestone timelines, actionable resource chips, and status/acknowledgement actions designed for large and compact layouts; the screen surfaces offline indicators when cached data is served and exposes refresh controls for operators.
- Registered the new screen in the global route map and surfaced it from the authenticated home menu so provider managers can navigate to migration tooling alongside existing course and community utilities.
