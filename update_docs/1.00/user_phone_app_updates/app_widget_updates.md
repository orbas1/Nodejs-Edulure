# Widget & Component Updates

- Implemented reusable offline/acknowledgement banners, status capture forms, and resource chips to power the provider transition hub while following accessibility and semantic guidelines (labels, tap targets, keyboard support).
- Added timeline and resource renderers that reuse Markdown and UrlLauncher, giving UX parity with the web dashboard without relying on embedded webviews.
