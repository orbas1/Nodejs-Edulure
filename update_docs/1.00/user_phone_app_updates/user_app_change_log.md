# Learner Mobile App â€“ Change Log

- Delivered the provider transition hub screen so provider success leads can consume migration briefs, review milestones, and act on readiness tasks directly from the learner companion without switching to spreadsheets or email threads.
- Introduced offline-aware caching for transition artefacts, acknowledgements, and status updates using a hardened session manager so field teams retain the latest instructions even when connectivity drops at partner sites.
- Added guided acknowledgement and status capture workflows that post to the new provider transition API while enforcing validation, surfacing submission feedback, and refreshing local state to keep app operators aligned with HQ telemetry.
