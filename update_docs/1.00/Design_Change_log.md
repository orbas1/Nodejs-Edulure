# Version 1.00 Design Change Log

## Executive Summary
The Version 1.00 design refresh harmonises the Flutter application shell and responsive web client by consolidating the guidance captured in `ui-ux_updates/Design_Task_Plan_Upgrade/Application_Design_Update_Plan` and `ui-ux_updates/Web Application Design Update`. The effort targets theme scalability, motion-safe interactions, and persona-tailored dashboards so that future component drops can inherit consistent tokens, layouts, and compliance affordances without rework.

## Primary Experience Areas
| Area | Change Summary | Rationale | Source Assets |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Global Theming & Tokens | Finalised the dark, light, and high-contrast palettes; unified typography stack and scale; refreshed spacing and elevation values to support new card taxonomy. | Ensure parity across web and Flutter builds while enabling emo/seasonal themes through token overrides. | `Application_Design_Update_Plan/Colours.md`, `Application_Design_Update_Plan/Fonts.md`, `Web Application Design Update/colours.md`, `Web Application Design Update/Css.md` |
| Navigation & Information Architecture | Re-indexed menus by role, surfaced contextual quick-actions, and defined breadcrumb/stepper variants for complex flows. | Reduce orientation friction for instructors and learners while preparing for new community and commerce modules. | `Application_Design_Update_Plan/Menus.md`, `Web Application Design Update/Menus.md`, `Web Application Design Update/component_types.md` |
| Home & Dashboard Surfaces | Introduced modular hero, progress, and insight tiles with seasonally themed imagery slots; codified widget hierarchy for dashboards and home feeds. | Support targeted campaigns, dynamic asset promotion, and granular analytics overlays. | `Application_Design_Update_Plan/Screens_Update.md`, `Web Application Design Update/Dashboard Designs.md`, `Web Application Design Update/Home page components.md` |
| Media & Resource Consumption | Rebuilt forms, cards, and resource drawers with explicit state treatments (loading, offline, rights restricted); added persistent annotation, bookmarking, and share affordances. | Improve accessibility compliance, clarify DRM states, and align with Cloudflare R2 asset handling. | `Application_Design_Update_Plan/Forms.md`, `Application_Design_Update_Plan/Cards.md`, `Web Application Design Update/component_functions.md`, `Web Application Design Update/Resources.md` |
| Profiles & Settings | Refined profile layouts, emphasising verification badges, monetisation controls, and activity stats; Settings receives dedicated privacy and notification clusters with inline guidance. | Provide trustworthy identity signals and support regulatory disclosure within a scalable layout. | `Web Application Design Update/Profile Styling.md`, `Application_Design_Update_Plan/Settings.md`, `Application_Design_Update_Plan/Settings Screen.md`, `Web Application Design Update/Settings Dashboard.md` |
| Imagery & Motion | Standardised hero, dashboard, and carousel imagery specs; defined animation curves and permissible motion per accessibility preferences. | Reduce bespoke asset requests and honour reduced-motion requirements. | `Application_Design_Update_Plan/Screens_update_images_and_vectors.md`, `Web Application Design Update/images_and_vectors.md`, `Web Application Design Update/Screen Size Changes.md` |

## Accessibility & Compliance Enhancements
- Adopted WCAG 2.2 AA colour contrast and focus treatment checklist, referencing `Application_Design_Update_Plan/Screen_update_Screen_colours.md` and `Web Application Design Update/buttons.md` to lock interactive states.
- Added copy decks and voice guidelines for hero modules and form helper text using `Application_Design_Update_Plan/Screen_text.md` and `Web Application Design Update/Home page text.md`.
- Documented localisation placeholders and RTL-aware layouts across menus and cards, using references from `Application_Design_Update_Plan/Organisation_and_positions.md`.

## Cross-Platform Harmonisation Notes
- Navigation and widget compositions now share identical naming conventions and component IDs between Flutter and React clients to streamline analytics instrumentation.
- Dark mode, emo theme packs, and festive overlays are abstracted into optional token bundles, ensuring theme swaps do not break baseline contrast or asset aspect ratios.
- Provider workflows inherit learner UI upgrades while exposing additional analytics segments and financial quick links, aligning with `provider_application_styling_changes.md` and `provider_application_logic_flow_changes.md`.

## Open Decisions
- Pending alignment on advanced dashboard data visualisation patterns; proposals captured in `Web Application Design Update/Dashboard Organisation.md` require engineering feasibility review.
- Need a dedicated imagery pipeline for seasonal campaigns; placeholder assets documented in `Web Application Design Update/Home page images.md` will be validated with marketing.
- Awaiting legal guidance on retention of annotation data surfaced in updated media drawers.

## Change Approval
