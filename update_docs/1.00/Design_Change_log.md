# Version 1.00 Design Change Log

## Executive Summary
Version 1.00 consolidates the recommendations captured across `ui-ux_updates/Design_Task_Plan_Upgrade/Application_Design_Update_Plan` and `ui-ux_updates/Design_Task_Plan_Upgrade/Web_Application_Design_Update` to refresh the entire Edulure experience layer. The update introduces token-driven theming (including emo and seasonal packs), restructures navigation hierarchies, hardens compliance and security messaging, and delivers new layout systems for learner, provider, and administrative surfaces. These changes ensure the responsive web application and Flutter clients share the same interaction contracts, asset specifications, and analytics instrumentation.

## Portfolio of Updates

### 12. Explorer Search & Ads Intelligence
- Finalised explorer layouts covering mixed-entity grids, saved search toasts, and pinned filters referencing `website_drawings.md`,
  `dashboard_drawings.md`, and `menu_drawings.md` so React/Flutter implementations align with Meilisearch index groupings (communities,
  courses, ebooks, tutors, ads, events) and the new facet definitions (tier, pricing, availability, campaign objective).
- Documented advanced filter drawers, synonym-backed quick actions, and zero-result states in `ui-ux_updates/Design_Task_Plan_Upgrade/Web_Application_Design_Update/Function Design.md`
  and `Application_Design_Update_Plan/Application Design Update.md`, ensuring copy highlights follow-graph boosts, tutor availability,
  and ad performance metrics now surfaced by the backend index settings.
- Calibrated the geospatial explorer panel using `website_drawings.md`, `dashboard_drawings.md`, and `App_screens_drawings.md` so the topojson map, keyboard-accessible focus rings, and hover-linked result highlights match the implemented `react-simple-maps` experience while respecting reduced-motion and high-contrast tokens.
- Delivered the dark-mode explorer intelligence board (`Screen_update_Screen_colours.md`, `Dashboard Designs.md`, `dashboard_drawings.md`) covering KPI chips, range toggles, manual refresh affordances, forecast cards, query spotlights, and alert banners so the `/analytics` route mirrors the SCR-11 admin analytics specifications with production typography, spacing, and accessibility cues.
- Expanded saved-search modal specifications in `menu_drawings.md` and `Design_Task_Plan_Upgrade/Web_Application_Design_Update/Web Application Design Update.md` to cover optimistic loading states, validation copy, toast sequencing, and analytics IDs so engineering instrumentation mirrors production UX for create, rename, pin, and delete flows.
- Added operator dashboards for search health—node status banners, snapshot prompts, and index drift alerts—within `Admin_panel_drawings.md`
  and `dashboard_drawings.md`, mirroring the new Prometheus metrics (`edulure_search_node_health`, `edulure_search_index_ready`) so SREs
  have visual hooks for incidents.
- Updated mobile explorer flows in `App_screens_drawings.md` with carousel-first entity tabs, offline recent searches, and ad creative previews,
  referencing the same synonym/ranking cues the backend enforces, plus chip-based voice search entry points tied to the new API contracts.
- Documented ingestion telemetry overlays in `dashboard_drawings.md` and `Admin_panel_drawings.md` showing batch progress, last-run timestamps, failure banners, and dataset freshness indicators aligned with `SearchIngestionService` metrics so operators and designers share expectations for reindex workflows across web and mobile consoles.
- Added ads compliance overlays tying campaign auto-pause states, spend alerts, and compliance review queues to `dashboard_drawings.md`, `website_drawings.md`, and `Admin_panel_drawings.md`, ensuring instructor dashboards surface violation copy, auto-pause toasts, and historical insight charts consistent with the AdsService governance rules.

## Accessibility, Security & Compliance Adjustments
- Enforced WCAG focus order, keyboard states, and ARIA labelling for updated forms and navigation components.
- Embedded security messaging around verification, payment confirmation, and rights-managed assets across profile and commerce flows.
- Reviewed JWT rotation backend hardening and confirmed no UI asset adjustments are required; security copy already references credential rotation guidance in profile and settings flows.
- Added localisation placeholders, RTL mirroring, and copy length buffers to all primary templates and microcopy decks.

## Cross-Platform Alignment
- Shared component taxonomy and asset specs across React and Flutter deliverables to ensure implementation parity.
- Token exports now map directly to CSS variables, Flutter theme objects, and backend-driven theme payloads to support runtime theme switching.
- Logic flow diagrams align provider workflows with learner experiences while exposing advanced analytics and financial controls.
- Documented npm workspace runtime requirements so design token packages, storybook previews, and frontend builds rely on the same Node/npm versions enforced across engineering environments.
- Confirmed runtime flag gating and admin disable states continue to render as designed after the backend test-to-development environment alias; no visual adjustments required.

## Open Items & Follow-Ups
- **Advanced Data Visualisation:** Validate charting libraries for analytics-heavy dashboards before engineering handoff.
- **Seasonal Asset Pipeline:** Coordinate marketing-provided imagery for emo and festive themes; placeholder assets captured in `Home page images.md` require art direction sign-off.
