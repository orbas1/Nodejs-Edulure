# Version 1.00 Design Change Log

## Executive Summary
Version 1.00 consolidates the recommendations captured across `ui-ux_updates/Design_Task_Plan_Upgrade/Application_Design_Update_Plan` and `ui-ux_updates/Design_Task_Plan_Upgrade/Web_Application_Design_Update` to refresh the entire Edulure experience layer. The update introduces token-driven theming (including emo and seasonal packs), restructures navigation hierarchies, hardens compliance and security messaging, and delivers new layout systems for learner, provider, and administrative surfaces. These changes ensure the responsive web application and Flutter clients share the same interaction contracts, asset specifications, and analytics instrumentation.

## Portfolio of Updates
### 1. Global Theming & Tokens
- Finalised palette families (default, high-contrast, emo, and seasonal overlays) with WCAG 2.2 AA contrast validation using colour matrices from `Colours.md`, `Screen_update_Screen_colours.md`, and `colours.md`.
- Standardised typography stacks, spacing, elevation, and shadow tiers aligned to `Fonts.md`, `Organisation_and_positions.md`, and `Scss.md`.
- Authored theme override logic for partial page takeovers (hero rows, promotional landers, community microsites) referencing `component_types.md` and `pages.md`.

### 2. Navigation, IA & Layout Rationalisation
- Re-indexed menus for learners, providers, and admins per `Menus.md`, `Organisation_and_positions.md`, and `Dashboard Organisation.md`.
- Added breadcrumb, quick-action, and stepper variants defined in `Logic_Flow_map.md`, `Screens_Update_Logic_Flow.md`, and `Screens_Update_Logic_Flow_map.md`.
- Introduced adaptive grid matrices and breakpoint rules guided by `Screen Size Changes.md`, `Placement.md`, and `Organisation_and_positions.md`.

### 3. Home, Dashboard & Page Templates
- Crafted modular hero, progress, recommendation, and campaign tiles with seasonal imagery slots referencing `Home page components.md`, `Dashboard Designs.md`, and `Screens_Update.md`.
- Delivered persona-specific dashboard arrangements (learner, provider, admin) leveraging `Dashboard Organisation.md`, `Settings Dashboard.md`, and `Profile Styling.md`.
- Authored new landing-page shells for explorer, communities, and monetisation flows using `Pages_list.md`, `Screens_list.md`, and `Home page components.md`.

### 4. Component & Interaction System
- Reworked cards, forms, modals, and drawers per `Cards.md`, `Forms.md`, `component_functions.md`, and `Screens__Update_widget_types.md` to include explicit idle/loading/offline/error/rights-restricted states.
- Mapped widget behaviours and inline analytics IDs to `Screens_Updates_widget_functions.md`, `component_types.md`, and `component_functions.md`.
- Hardened microcopy and interaction guidance using `Screen_text.md`, `text.md.md`, and `Dummy_Data_Requirements.md` with compliance review loops.

### 5. Imagery, Motion & Asset Governance
- Standardised imagery ratios, safe areas, and animation tiers referencing `images_and_vectors.md`, `Screens_update_images_and _vectors.md`, and `Screen_buttons.md`.
- Defined reduced-motion fallbacks and state transitions aligned with `Logic_Flow_update.md` and `Screens_Update_Plan.md`.
- Introduced marketing asset intake workflows and seasonal asset packs referencing `Home page images.md`, `Resources.md`, and `Assets.md`.

### 6. Profile, Settings & Compliance Reinforcement
- Refreshed profile layouts with verification badges, monetisation widgets, and content shelves via `Profile Look.md`, `Profile Styling.md`, and `Organisation_and_positions.md`.
- Restructured settings dashboards, privacy controls, and notification clusters using `Settings Dashboard.md`, `Settings Screen.md`, and `Settings.md`.
- Embedded legal consent, security prompts, and audit trails referencing `Function Design.md`, `component_functions.md`, and `provider_application_logic_flow_changes.md`.

## Accessibility, Security & Compliance Adjustments
- Enforced WCAG focus order, keyboard states, and ARIA labelling for updated forms and navigation components.
- Embedded security messaging around verification, payment confirmation, and rights-managed assets across profile and commerce flows.
- Reviewed JWT rotation backend hardening and confirmed no UI asset adjustments are required; security copy already references credential rotation guidance in profile and settings flows.
- Added localisation placeholders, RTL mirroring, and copy length buffers to all primary templates and microcopy decks.

## Cross-Platform Alignment
- Shared component taxonomy and asset specs across React and Flutter deliverables to ensure implementation parity.
- Token exports now map directly to CSS variables, Flutter theme objects, and backend-driven theme payloads to support runtime theme switching.
- Logic flow diagrams align provider workflows with learner experiences while exposing advanced analytics and financial controls.
- Documented npm workspace runtime requirements so design token packages, storybook previews, and frontend builds rely on the same Node/npm versions enforced across engineering environments.

## Open Items & Follow-Ups
- **Advanced Data Visualisation:** Validate charting libraries for analytics-heavy dashboards before engineering handoff.
- **Seasonal Asset Pipeline:** Coordinate marketing-provided imagery for emo and festive themes; placeholder assets captured in `Home page images.md` require art direction sign-off.
- **Annotation Retention:** Await legal guidance on storing collaborative annotations introduced in the new media drawers.

## Approval Log
- **Design Authority:** Product Design Lead – approval granted 2024-05-10.
- **Engineering Review:** Frontend, Flutter, and Backend chapter leads – approval granted 2024-05-12.
- **Compliance & Security:** Privacy, legal, and security partners – approval granted 2024-05-13 with mitigation actions tracked in Jira (DSN-1201 – DSN-1204).
- Finalised verification and lockout microcopy across onboarding, settings, and support flows referencing `Screen_text.md`, `text.md.md`, and `Settings Dashboard.md`, ensuring parity with the new backend governance controls.
