# Version 1.00 Update Change Log

## Documentation & Evaluation Additions
- Published an enablement knowledge base package with production-ready operator onboarding, analytics curriculum, and communications kit guides plus `/enablement` APIs that expose searchable content, capability matrices, and reindex hooks for downstream portals. 【F:backend-nodejs/src/enablement/content/operator-onboarding-playbook.md†L1-L98】【F:backend-nodejs/src/enablement/content/analytics-revenue-enablement.md†L1-L90】【F:backend-nodejs/src/enablement/content/stakeholder-communications-kit.md†L1-L87】【F:backend-nodejs/src/controllers/EnablementController.js†L1-L78】
- Established the Version 1.00 update documentation workspace derived from the base template so the team can track change requests, testing, and rollout tasks in a consistent format.
- Authored deeply critical pre-update evaluations for backend, database, dependency, front-end, and learner mobile app surfaces to surface high-risk gaps across functionality, usability, error handling, integration, security, and roadmap alignment.
- Added a provider operations app evaluation to capture regressions that remain after retiring the legacy mobile experience and to ensure any successor tooling is reviewed before reintroduction.
- Expanded every pre-update evaluation with additional findings covering operational readiness, performance, observability, compliance, and roadmap alignment gaps uncovered during the second review pass.
- Documented cross-cutting risks such as missing runbooks, absent automation, and marketing misalignments so leadership can prioritise remediation before approving the 1.00 rollout.
- Conducted a fourth evaluation sweep to catalogue advanced operational, integration, and security deficiencies (e.g., LMS connector persistence gaps, unencrypted provider exports, mobile token storage issues) ensuring leadership has granular remediation items before sign-off.

## Removals & Scope Decisions
- Confirmed that all provider phone app assets remain deprecated for this cycle; no resurrection tasks are scheduled until a new business case is approved, preventing scope creep.
- Completed the fifth evaluation sweep incorporating full-stack static and dynamic scans, dependency audits, and mobile build readiness checks; recorded the expanded backend, database, dependency, frontend, provider, and learner findings in the evaluation dossiers.
- Initiated build and test verification runs (backend unit suite, frontend production bundle) to validate the documentation against actual project health, capturing failures for engineering follow-up.

## Backend Stabilisation
- Delivered the instructor course workspace domain models (`CourseModel`, `CourseModuleModel`, `CourseLessonModel`,
  `CourseAssignmentModel`, `CourseEnrollmentModel`, `CourseProgressModel`) and wired `DashboardService.getDashboardForUser`
  to lazily hydrate catalogue, cohort analytics, assignments, authoring drafts, and learner risk signals only when instructors
  actually own courses, cutting unnecessary imports while returning a production-ready `coursesWorkspace` payload for the API.
- Implemented a production-grade domain event dispatch pipeline powered by a persistent queue, exponential backoff, jitter, and Prometheus metrics so domain events now flow reliably to webhook subscribers instead of remaining passive audit rows.
- Registered the dispatcher with the worker service readiness probes to ensure background automation boots alongside existing schedulers and surfaces health in probes and logs.
- Hardened the domain event model with JSON normalisation, transaction-aware dispatch enqueueing, and backward-compatible options so existing services transparently gain outbox support.
- Delivered manifest-driven feature flag governance with bootstrap synchronisation, tenant override storage, and admin APIs so operators can activate capabilities safely across tenants without database changes or engineer intervention.
- Wrapped Stripe, PayPal, CloudConvert, and Twilio integrations with sandbox-aware gateways, Redis-backed circuit breakers, idempotent webhook receipts, and retry/backoff orchestration while updating payment flows and community reminders to consume the new abstractions.
- Rebuilt the CloudConvert client on top of native fetch with retry, timeout, and circuit breaker semantics so asset ingestion no longer depends on deprecated SDK wrappers when handling PowerPoint conversions. 【F:backend-nodejs/src/integrations/CloudConvertClient.js†L1-L210】
- Centralised compliance evidence capture with a dedicated audit event service that encrypts IP telemetry, enforces metadata retention limits, and wires controller request context into every DSR and consent lifecycle change.
- Expanded the compliance stack with attestation analytics, evidence archive discovery, and risk heatmap builders powering the operator dashboard, including database accessors for archive listings and policy coverage summaries.

## Data & Infrastructure Updates
- Added a managed migration that creates the `domain_event_dispatch_queue` table with status tracking, lock metadata, and retry scheduling to persist event delivery state across restarts.
- Extended configuration surfaces (.env, runtime loader, and test harness) with tunable dispatcher controls (batch sizing, backoff, recovery intervals) while documenting defaults in the update notes.
- Created the `feature_flag_tenant_states` table and manifest catalogue, wiring bootstrap automation to keep flag definitions aligned with documentation and audit overrides per tenant/environment.
- Delivered analytics-ready MySQL views that aggregate enrolment momentum, community engagement, and daily revenue to unblock operator dashboards and finance reconciliations without bespoke SQL.
- Checked in a schema governance baseline and CLI guard so CI and scheduled jobs surface migration drift before it lands in production environments.
- Built an observability fabric that streams HTTP telemetry into a time-windowed SLO registry, exposes `/observability/slos` APIs with governance metadata, and ships Prometheus-authenticated metrics alongside alert-ready error budget snapshots.
- Standardised infrastructure parity with reusable Terraform modules, environment manifests, hardened Docker images, and an `/environment/health` API that hashes deployment artefacts and dependency probes so release operations can detect drift before promoting builds. 【F:infrastructure/terraform/README.md†L1-L51】【F:infrastructure/environment-manifest.json†L1-L38】【F:backend-nodejs/src/services/EnvironmentParityService.js†L1-L217】【F:backend-nodejs/src/routes/environmentParity.routes.js†L1-L9】
- Instituted automated supply-chain governance with repository-wide Dependabot coverage, a dependency-governance workflow that runs npm audit, license reporting, SBOM generation, Trivy, and Scorecard checks, a release-time SLSA provenance workflow, and hardened security scripts plus workspace wiring to generate compliance reports on demand. 【F:.github/dependabot.yml†L1-L54】【F:.github/workflows/dependency-governance.yml†L1-L95】【F:.github/workflows/slsa-provenance.yml†L1-L20】【F:scripts/security/generate-license-report.mjs†L1-L137】【F:scripts/security/run-npm-audit.mjs†L1-L161】【F:package.json†L16-L43】
- Delivered a dedicated security operations surface covering risk register analytics, audit evidence intake, continuity drill governance, and assessment scheduling with new database migrations, repositories, services, controllers, routes, and OpenAPI contracts so compliance owners can demonstrate enterprise risk management maturity from production APIs. 【F:backend-nodejs/migrations/20241122120000_security_compliance_risk_operations.js†L1-L213】【F:backend-nodejs/src/services/SecurityOperationsService.js†L1-L421】【F:backend-nodejs/src/controllers/SecurityOperationsController.js†L1-L199】【F:backend-nodejs/src/routes/security.routes.js†L1-L17】【F:backend-nodejs/src/docs/openapi.json†L1-L9999】
- Stood up a governed telemetry warehouse pipeline with consent-aware MySQL tables, ingestion/export services, REST endpoints, and a scheduled job so analytics and compliance teams receive production-grade event feeds with automated freshness and lineage instrumentation. 【F:backend-nodejs/src/database/domains/telemetry.js†L1-L199】【F:backend-nodejs/src/services/TelemetryIngestionService.js†L1-L173】【F:backend-nodejs/src/services/TelemetryWarehouseService.js†L1-L197】【F:backend-nodejs/src/routes/telemetry.routes.js†L1-L11】【F:backend-nodejs/src/jobs/telemetryWarehouseJob.js†L1-L121】
- Delivered an executive BI insight layer with governed reporting views, a business intelligence service/controller pair, documented OpenAPI contracts, and authenticated HTTP routes so leadership can access daily enrollment, community, and revenue KPIs via `/analytics/bi/executive-overview`. 【F:backend-nodejs/src/models/ReportingCourseEnrollmentDailyView.js†L1-L104】【F:backend-nodejs/src/services/BusinessIntelligenceService.js†L1-L265】【F:backend-nodejs/src/controllers/BusinessIntelligenceController.js†L1-L26】【F:backend-nodejs/src/routes/analytics.routes.js†L1-L12】【F:backend-nodejs/src/docs/openapi.json†L8800-L9560】
- Centralised tenant metadata scoping across monetisation services by introducing a reusable SQL builder that normalises JSON paths per dialect (MySQL, PostgreSQL, SQLite) and wiring targeted tests to guarantee reconciliation windows respect tenant boundaries regardless of the backing database. 【F:backend-nodejs/src/database/utils/tenantMetadataScope.js†L1-L48】【F:backend-nodejs/test/tenantMetadataScope.test.js†L1-L63】
- Delivered refund-aware monetisation controls that reverse recognised revenue, trim deferred schedules, and emit finance-grade metrics whenever Stripe or PayPal refunds land so reconciliation variance stays below the 0.5% tolerance promised to auditors. 【F:backend-nodejs/src/services/MonetizationFinanceService.js†L302-L613】【F:backend-nodejs/src/models/MonetizationRevenueScheduleModel.js†L1-L216】【F:backend-nodejs/src/services/PaymentService.js†L1039-L1384】【F:backend-nodejs/src/observability/metrics.js†L120-L206】【F:backend-nodejs/test/monetizationFinanceService.test.js†L200-L266】
- Stood up governance and stakeholder communications capabilities with seeded contract, vendor assessment, review cycle, and roadmap communication data plus `/governance` APIs, metrics, and tests so programme owners can steer enterprise contract renewals, vendor risk, and proactive roadmap comms from production tooling. 【F:backend-nodejs/migrations/20250305110000_governance_stakeholder_operations.js†L1-L164】【F:backend-nodejs/src/services/GovernanceStakeholderService.js†L1-L212】【F:backend-nodejs/src/controllers/GovernanceController.js†L1-L164】【F:backend-nodejs/src/routes/governance.routes.js†L1-L21】【F:backend-nodejs/test/governanceStakeholderService.test.js†L1-L167】【F:backend-nodejs/test/governanceHttpRoutes.test.js†L1-L120】
- Built a release readiness orchestration stack with dedicated migrations, seeds, metrics, service orchestration, controller/routes, and OpenAPI contracts so release engineering can automate checklist governance, gate evaluations, readiness scoring, and dashboards when shipping Version 1.00. 【F:backend-nodejs/migrations/20250305113000_release_management.js†L1-L96】【F:backend-nodejs/seeds/001_bootstrap.js†L3487-L3672】【F:backend-nodejs/src/services/ReleaseOrchestrationService.js†L1-L461】【F:backend-nodejs/src/controllers/ReleaseManagementController.js†L1-L139】【F:backend-nodejs/src/routes/release.routes.js†L1-L13】【F:backend-nodejs/src/observability/metrics.js†L202-L330】【F:backend-nodejs/src/observability/metrics.js†L815-L858】【F:backend-nodejs/src/docs/openapi.json†L22690-L23125】

## Quality Assurance
- Authored automated unit coverage for the dispatcher service validating success, retry, and acknowledgement paths, and executed the Vitest target suite to guarantee deterministic behaviour for the new pipeline.
- Added coverage for tenant override evaluation and governance sync workflows, exercising the new manifest automation and admin endpoints through Vitest to prevent regressions.
- Added unit coverage for the schema guard diff engine to ensure drift detection logic remains stable as new tables and indexes are added.
- Authored dedicated tests for the audit event service validating IP encryption, request-context enrichment, and metadata truncation so the new compliance telemetry remains deterministic.
- Introduced regression coverage for the compliance console tab switching and evidence export rendering to guard the new admin UI from state-management regressions.
- Added Ajv-backed contract validation for the observability SLO endpoints to guarantee the runtime responses adhere to the published OpenAPI schema as the telemetry surface evolves.
- Implemented a release readiness harness that runs backend health/load probes, frontend accessibility scans, targeted linting, supply-chain audits, and checklist validation so go/no-go decisions include automated evidence.

## Operator Experience Modernisation
- Completed the instructor learning workspace by surfacing catalogue analytics, assignment pipelines, authoring drafts with
  localisation coverage, and learner management tables in `InstructorCourseManage`, adding persistence-backed modals and new
  vitest coverage for the sections to guarantee production behaviour.
- Rebuilt the executive operator overview into a production-grade command centre that surfaces live KPIs, consolidated incident metrics, release readiness, and cross-tenant status from service health feeds with responsive layouts tuned for desktop and tablet operators.
- Added a persistent executive dashboard data orchestration layer that coordinates tenant-aware API calls, caches results in IndexedDB for offline fallback, auto-refreshes while the tab is visible, and exposes manual refresh plus connectivity banners to operators.
- Extended the dashboard shell to route admin users through the new experience while preserving existing learner and instructor journeys, ensuring role-aware navigation stays intact even when the admin payload is unavailable.
- Shipped targeted Vitest coverage for the executive data hook to validate happy-path loading, caching, and degradation behaviour so operators always see deterministic data during network turbulence.
- Delivered the admin compliance console experience with audits, attestation coverage, framework trackers, incident response queues, risk heatmaps, and evidence export management wired to the new backend analytics and secure download controls.
- Built the finance and monetisation centres with tenant-aware data orchestration, billing and aging analytics, payout approval workflows, ledger reconciliation dashboards, experimentation controls, and pricing catalogue governance so operators can run revenue operations without engineering support.
- Launched the support, communications, and settings hub with a tenant-aware command centre covering ticket triage, escalation workflows, automation health, knowledge base governance, broadcast scheduling, and notification policy management so frontline teams can honour SLAs without leaving the operator experience.
- Replaced the Explorer map stack with a D3 + topojson rendering pipeline, adding world topology assets, zoom/pan interactions, and dependency upgrades to eliminate the unmaintained react-simple-maps package. 【F:frontend-reactjs/src/pages/Explorer.jsx†L1-L220】【F:frontend-reactjs/package.json†L22-L59】

## Provider & Mobile Enablement
- Introduced the provider transition programme API surface backed by durable schema (`provider_transition_*` tables), service orchestration, validation, and acknowledgement/state update endpoints so partner success can run migration comms, readiness attestations, and rollout telemetry from the core platform instead of spreadsheets.
- Added coverage-driven Vitest suites for the provider transition service and HTTP routes ensuring active announcement rollups, acknowledgement validation, and status-code governance behave deterministically and remain observable through new route metadata and feature flag controls.
- Delivered a production-grade provider transition hub inside the learner Flutter app with offline-aware caching, markdown-guided briefs, milestone timelines, actionable resources, acknowledgement workflows, and migration status capture integrated with secure session storage and telemetry so field operators can manage go-live readiness from mobile devices even when connectivity is unreliable.

- Hardened monetisation reconciliation with tenant-aware scheduling, DB-agnostic payment intent filtering, shared revenue schedule hydration, and documented admin envelopes to progress Task 5 monetisation objectives.
