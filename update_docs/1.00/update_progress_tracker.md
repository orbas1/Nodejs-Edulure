**Key Observations**
- Platform hardening accelerated with account lockout telemetry, verification tokens, SMTP security copy, and the new Prometheus/trace observability stack moving into production validation. Session rotation/log-out tooling with cached validation now shields revoked tokens across web and mobile clients.
- Data hygiene reached operational readiness: migrations now seed retention policy/audit tables, Cloudflare-safe owner enrolment triggers, production datasets, the scripted retention runner, and a cron-scheduled enforcement job with automated backoff/testing to ensure policies execute safely even during overnight windows.
- Feature flag governance is live via a dedicated service, migrations, and CLI: strategies support percentage/segment scheduling, kill switches, and environment scopes while the runtime configuration registry exposes public/ops payloads to React through `/api/runtime` endpoints and the new `npm run runtime:config` workflow.
- Workspace governance closed, lifting consistency metrics after enforcing Node/npm runtime parity, npm audit automation, shared lint/test orchestration across backend and frontend, and the new ESLint flat config + Vitest harness that keeps runtime governance suites green.
- Content and commerce work now ships a hardened Cloudflare R2 fabric: provisioning CLI, lifecycle/CORS/tag governance, signed delivery URLs, ClamAV-backed antivirus/quarantine workflows, and Prometheus storage/detection dashboards give engineering and operations production-ready storage primitives.
- Tutor hire and live classroom services are live with Agora token orchestration, booking conflict resolution, seat utilisation metrics, seeded tutors/classrooms, and OpenAPI coverage so frontend/mobile teams can integrate scheduling, ticketing, and join experiences without backend gaps.
- Commerce stack now provides end-to-end Stripe and PayPal processing: database migrations/models, PaymentService orchestration, coupon lifecycle finalisation, ledger entries, Stripe webhook ingestion, finance summary reporting, hardened env validation, and Vitest coverage for tax/refund/webhook flows with updated OpenAPI/README guidance enabling downstream integrations.
- Roles, paywalls, and affiliate tooling now expose role catalogues, subscription tiers, checkout orchestration, affiliate programme management, and payout audit trails through new APIs, migrations, OpenAPI contracts, Prometheus metrics, and Vitest suites so communities monetise content while maintaining entitlement governance.
- Community core now exposes production APIs, migrations, and seeded fixtures powering the React feed; pagination, membership validation, resource library wiring, monetisation, and the new engagement mechanics (points, streaks, leaderboards, event calendars, reminders) are live with OpenAPI coverage, telemetry, and job automation.
- Community chat and direct messaging now ship with dedicated migrations, services, controllers, routes, seeds, OpenAPI coverage, presence tracking, moderation events, and Vitest service + HTTP tests so messaging surfaces are production ready for web, mobile, and ops consumers.
- Social graph services now run with transactional privacy enforcement, reciprocal recommendation orchestration, defensive mute and block cleanup, hardened environment controls, and swagger-validated OpenAPI contracts backed by service + HTTP Vitest suites to unlock feed ranking, discovery, and moderation tooling.
- Messaging design overlays (chat docks, DM inbox/thread panes, moderation consoles, presence beacons, unread badges, and DND prompts) now reference `dashboard_drawings.md`, `menu_drawings.md`, `website_drawings.md`, `Admin_panel_drawings.md`, and `App_screens_drawings.md`, aligning the refreshed documentation with the backend pagination and TTL contracts introduced this cycle.
- Social, explorer, dashboard, mobile, and QA programmes await foundational dependencies; progress is intentionally gated until upstream services stabilise.
- Dashboards, mobile parity, and launch-readiness workstreams now have three micro-sprints apiece to reduce risk and unblock incremental delivery despite previous broad task failures.
- Explorer infrastructure now includes ingestion: SearchIngestionService batches and parallelises ETL for communities, courses, ebooks, tutors, profiles, ads, and events with incremental `since` filters, Prometheus coverage (`edulure_search_ingestion_documents_total`, `edulure_search_ingestion_failures_total`, `edulure_search_ingestion_last_run_seconds`), and the operational `npm run search:reindex` CLI. Fresh migrations/seed data hydrate course, ebook, tutor, live classroom, and ads intelligence tables so Meilisearch indexes receive production-ready payloads after each deploy.
- Explorer UX shipped with production fidelity: `/explorer` orchestrates cross-entity tabs, adaptive facet rails, controlled saved-search CRUD flows, keyboard-accessible geo markers, zero-result education, optimistic loading toasts, and Meilisearch-backed telemetry wiring. Navigation, auth guards, and analytics IDs align with design artefacts, while backend Prometheus metrics surface in the operator consoles.
- Ads compliance automation is now enforced through AdsService—overspending campaigns are auto-paused with compliance metadata persisted, insights return chronologically ordered metrics, Vitest covers compliance/insight flows, and the Vite build validates the explorer/ads dashboards end-to-end following dependency reconciliation.
- Explorer intelligence dashboards now mirror the backend analytics stack: the React `/analytics` route exposes authenticated range controls, live KPIs, entity and ads breakdowns, forecast summaries, query spotlights, and alert styling tied to the ExplorerAnalyticsService endpoints with manual refresh, empty state handling, and navigation gating so operations teams can monitor health without resorting to raw APIs.
