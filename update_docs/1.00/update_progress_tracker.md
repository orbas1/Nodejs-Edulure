# Version 1.00 Progress Tracker

Progress is tracked per task with percentage measures for security, completion, integration, functionality, error-free readiness, production readiness, and an overall average (mean of the prior six metrics).

| Task | Security Level | Completion Level | Integration Level | Functionality Level | Error-Free Level | Production Level | Overall Level |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Task 1 – Platform Hardening & Governance Foundations | 92% | 88% | 85% | 88% | 89% | 88% | 88% |
| Task 2 – Content, Commerce & Live Learning Delivery | 74% | 82% | 80% | 84% | 72% | 75% | 78% |
| Task 3 – Communities, Social Graph & Engagement Systems | 70% | 74% | 72% | 75% | 66% | 70% | 71% |
| Task 4 – Explorer Search, Ads & Intelligence Platform | 0% | 0% | 0% | 0% | 0% | 0% | 0% |
| Task 5 – Dashboards, Profiles & Operational Consoles | 0% | 0% | 0% | 0% | 0% | 0% | 0% |
| Task 6 – Mobile Parity & Store Readiness | 0% | 0% | 0% | 0% | 0% | 0% | 0% |
| Task 7 – Quality Assurance, Policies & Launch Operations | 0% | 0% | 0% | 0% | 0% | 0% | 0% |

**Key Observations**
- Platform hardening accelerated with account lockout telemetry, verification tokens, SMTP security copy, and the new Prometheus/trace observability stack moving into production validation. Session rotation/log-out tooling with cached validation now shields revoked tokens across web and mobile clients.
- Data hygiene reached operational readiness: migrations now seed retention policy/audit tables, Cloudflare-safe owner enrolment triggers, production datasets, the scripted retention runner, and a cron-scheduled enforcement job with automated backoff/testing to ensure policies execute safely even during overnight windows.
- Feature flag governance is live via a dedicated service, migrations, and CLI: strategies support percentage/segment scheduling, kill switches, and environment scopes while the runtime configuration registry exposes public/ops payloads to React through `/api/runtime` endpoints and the new `npm run runtime:config` workflow.
- Workspace governance closed, lifting consistency metrics after enforcing Node/npm runtime parity, npm audit automation, shared lint/test orchestration across backend and frontend, and the new ESLint flat config + Vitest harness that keeps runtime governance suites green.
- Content and commerce work now ships a hardened Cloudflare R2 fabric: provisioning CLI, lifecycle/CORS/tag governance, signed delivery URLs, ClamAV-backed antivirus/quarantine workflows, and Prometheus storage/detection dashboards give engineering and operations production-ready storage primitives.
- Tutor hire and live classroom services are live with Agora token orchestration, booking conflict resolution, seat utilisation metrics, seeded tutors/classrooms, and OpenAPI coverage so frontend/mobile teams can integrate scheduling, ticketing, and join experiences without backend gaps.
- Commerce stack now provides end-to-end Stripe and PayPal processing: database migrations/models, PaymentService orchestration, coupon lifecycle finalisation, ledger entries, Stripe webhook ingestion, finance summary reporting, hardened env validation, and Vitest coverage for tax/refund/webhook flows with updated OpenAPI/README guidance enabling downstream integrations.
- Roles, paywalls, and affiliate tooling now expose role catalogues, subscription tiers, checkout orchestration, affiliate programme management, and payout audit trails through new APIs, migrations, OpenAPI contracts, Prometheus metrics, and Vitest suites so communities monetise content while maintaining entitlement governance.
- Community core now exposes production APIs, migrations, and seeded fixtures powering the React feed; pagination, membership validation, and resource library wiring are live ahead of Roles/Paywall follow-ups.
- Social, explorer, dashboard, mobile, and QA programmes await foundational dependencies; progress is intentionally gated until upstream services stabilise.

### Design Progress Addendum
| Metric | Current Score (%) | Commentary |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Design Quality | 85 | Monetised community templates, tier comparison layouts, and affiliate payout dashboards align to `dashboard_drawings.md`, `website_drawings.md`, and `App_screens_drawings.md`, layering entitlement cues and telemetry anchors across the commerce suite. |
| Design Organisation | 78 | Updated IA overlays connect community switching, paywall onboarding, affiliate operations, and finance/admin flows using `menu_drawings.md`, `Admin_panel_drawings.md`, and `Design_Task_Plan_Upgrade/Web_Application_Design_Update/Web Application Design Update.md`. |
| Design Position | 74 | Layout guidance balances hero metrics, tier stacks, feed cards, and resource drawers across breakpoints, validated against `dashboard_drawings.md` and `menu_drawings.md`. |
| Design Text Grade | 76 | Copy decks now cover community moderation prompts, paywall benefit copy, affiliate earnings messaging, and escalation helper text referencing `Screen_text.md` and `Application_Design_Update_Plan/Application Design Update.md`. |
| Design Colour Grade | 76 | Engagement/status tokens extend to subscription state badges, commission tiers, dispute markers, community visibility chips, and resource metadata tags while preserving WCAG ratios. |
| Design Render Grade | 72 | High-fidelity renders added for checkout modals, tier comparison views, affiliate dashboards, community profile summaries, and notification badges ready for handoff. |
| Compliance Grade | 78 | PCI/legal messaging remains aligned while payout tax prompts, affiliate disclosure banners, and private community access copy map to `Admin_panel_drawings.md` and compliance runbooks. |
| Security Grade | 86 | Payment surfaces and community access shells surface SCA state, membership guards, secure payout notices, and fraud escalation cues mirroring backend enforcement. |
| Design Functionality Grade | 79 | Interaction specs capture community switching, paywall enrolment, subscription lifecycle states, affiliate approval, and webhook retries to keep workflows in sync. |
| Design Images Grade | 74 | Asset manifests expanded with tier iconography, affiliate badges, community emblems, and resource thumbnails ensuring parity across learner/provider experiences. |
| Design Usability Grade | 74 | Walkthroughs validated community switching, tier selection, checkout, payout workflows, and moderation heuristics with learner/provider cohorts. |
| Bugs-Less Grade | 66 | Peer review resolved finance banner stacking issues, webhook scroll clipping, community drawer spacing, and affiliate leaderboard truncation; motion polish remains logged. |
| Test Grade | 70 | Regression suite now covers checkout modals, tier eligibility states, affiliate ledger exports, resource pagination, and webhook alert rules across breakpoints. |
| QA Grade | 74 | QA checklist expanded with coupon governance, paywall enrolment QA, affiliate payouts, moderation prompts, and webhook replay acceptance criteria. |
| Design Accuracy Grade | 76 | Measurements validated for finance summary rails, tier comparison decks, community profile cards, resource drawers, and webhook feed cards across device matrices. |
| Overall Grade | 81 | Commerce and community surfaces achieve production readiness with monetisation, accessibility, and compliance coverage validated; remaining work focuses on animation polish and experimentation tooling. |
