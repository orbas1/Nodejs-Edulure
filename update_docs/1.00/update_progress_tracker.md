**Key Observations**
- Version 1.00 is now production ready across every pillar. All backend services, React dashboards, and Flutter clients are aligned behind the same runtime governance suite, and the cross-domain telemetry/alerting stack has been validated through the final launch drills.
- Mobile parity and store readiness are complete. Flutter learner and instructor shells now ship with community, explorer, classroom, ebook, and commerce modules, offline caches, push notifications, deep-link routing, and storefront assets signed off by both Apple and Google reviewers.
- Quality, policy, and launch operations hit green status. Automated regression (Vitest, Playwright, Flutter integration), load/security scans, and accessibility tooling gate every pipeline; war-room runbooks, moderation/legal playbooks, and support knowledge bases were published and rehearsed with operations, support, and trust & safety teams.
- Platform hardening accelerated with account lockout telemetry, verification tokens, SMTP security copy, and the new Prometheus/trace observability stack moving into production validation. Session rotation/log-out tooling with cached validation now shields revoked tokens across web and mobile clients.
- Data hygiene reached operational readiness: migrations now seed retention policy/audit tables, Cloudflare-safe owner enrolment triggers, production datasets, the scripted retention runner, and a cron-scheduled enforcement job with automated backoff/testing to ensure policies execute safely even during overnight windows.
- Feature flag governance is live via a dedicated service, migrations, and CLI: strategies support percentage/segment scheduling, kill switches, and environment scopes while the runtime configuration registry exposes public/ops payloads to React through `/api/runtime` endpoints and the new `npm run runtime:config` workflow.
- Workspace governance closed, lifting consistency metrics after enforcing Node/npm runtime parity, npm audit automation, shared lint/test orchestration across backend and frontend, and the new ESLint flat config + Vitest harness that keeps runtime governance suites green.
- Content and commerce work now ships a hardened Cloudflare R2 fabric: provisioning CLI, lifecycle/CORS/tag governance, signed delivery URLs, ClamAV-backed antivirus/quarantine workflows, and Prometheus storage/detection dashboards give engineering and operations production-ready storage primitives.
- Tutor hire and live classroom services are live with Agora token orchestration, booking conflict resolution, seat utilisation metrics, seeded tutors/classrooms, and OpenAPI coverage so frontend/mobile teams can integrate scheduling, ticketing, and join experiences without backend gaps.
- Commerce stack now provides end-to-end Stripe and PayPal processing: database migrations/models, PaymentService orchestration, coupon lifecycle finalisation, ledger entries, Stripe webhook ingestion, finance summary reporting, hardened env validation, and Vitest coverage for tax/refund/webhook flows with updated OpenAPI/README guidance enabling downstream integrations.
- Roles, paywalls, and affiliate tooling now expose role catalogues, subscription tiers, checkout orchestration, affiliate programme management, and payout audit trails through new APIs, migrations, OpenAPI contracts, Prometheus metrics, and Vitest suites so communities monetise content while maintaining entitlement governance.
- Community core now exposes production APIs, migrations, and seeded fixtures powering the React feed; pagination, membership validation, resource library wiring, monetisation, and the new engagement mechanics (points, streaks, leaderboards, event calendars, reminders) are live with OpenAPI coverage, telemetry, and job automation.
- Community chat and direct messaging now ship with dedicated migrations, services, controllers, routes, seeds, OpenAPI coverage, presence tracking, moderation events, and Vitest service + HTTP tests so messaging surfaces are production ready for web, mobile, and ops consumers.
- Social graph services now run with transactional privacy enforcement, reciprocal recommendation orchestration, defensive mute and block cleanup, hardened environment controls, and swagger-validated OpenAPI contracts backed by service + HTTP Vitest suites to unlock feed ranking, discovery, and moderation tooling.
- Messaging design overlays (chat docks, DM inbox/thread panes, moderation consoles, presence beacons, unread badges, and DND prompts) now reference `dashboard_drawings.md`, `menu_drawings.md`, `website_drawings.md`, `Admin_panel_drawings.md`, and `App_screens_drawings.md`, aligning the refreshed documentation with the backend pagination and TTL contracts introduced this cycle.
- Flutter architecture matured into a full production suite: Riverpod governs global state, `AppBootstrap` initialises secure storage, push notifications, and analytics, shared Dio interceptors attach auth/telemetry, Sentry instrumentation captures crashes, feature flags hydrate from the runtime service, and offline caches plus deep-link routing are validated across both learner and instructor shells.
- Dashboards, mobile parity, and launch-readiness workstreams closed out their micro-sprints with retrospective fixes folded into the release branch, leaving no outstanding blockers for downstream teams.
- Explorer infrastructure now includes ingestion: SearchIngestionService batches and parallelises ETL for communities, courses, ebooks, tutors, profiles, ads, and events with incremental `since` filters, Prometheus coverage (`edulure_search_ingestion_documents_total`, `edulure_search_ingestion_failures_total`, `edulure_search_ingestion_last_run_seconds`), and the operational `npm run search:reindex` CLI. Fresh migrations/seed data hydrate course, ebook, tutor, live classroom, and ads intelligence tables so Meilisearch indexes receive production-ready payloads after each deploy.
- Explorer UX shipped with production fidelity: `/explorer` orchestrates cross-entity tabs, adaptive facet rails, controlled saved-search CRUD flows, keyboard-accessible geo markers, zero-result education, optimistic loading toasts, and Meilisearch-backed telemetry wiring. Navigation, auth guards, and analytics IDs align with design artefacts, while backend Prometheus metrics surface in the operator consoles.
- Ads compliance automation is now enforced through AdsService—overspending campaigns are auto-paused with compliance metadata persisted, insights return chronologically ordered metrics, Vitest covers compliance/insight flows, and the Vite build validates the explorer/ads dashboards end-to-end following dependency reconciliation.
- Explorer intelligence dashboards now mirror the backend analytics stack: the React `/analytics` route exposes authenticated range controls, live KPIs, entity and ads breakdowns, forecast summaries, query spotlights, and alert styling tied to the ExplorerAnalyticsService endpoints with manual refresh, empty state handling, and navigation gating so operations teams can monitor health without resorting to raw APIs.
- Profile overview orchestration landed with `/api/profiles/{id}/overview`: the aggregation service hydrates hero metrics, engagement insights, programme shelves, quick actions, and timeline events with TTL caching, while the React profile route consumes the live payload via a new caching hook and production-grade components aligned to `Profile Look.md`, `Profile Styling.md`, and `dashboard_drawings.md`. Backend API/service/controller/route documentation, frontend change logs, and design plans/trackers were refreshed to capture the new profile experience so Task 5.1 is fully documented for downstream squads.
- Learner dashboard delivery now includes a production notification centre, follower governance workspace, and privacy/messaging controls. `DashboardService` enriches the learner aggregate with notifications/follower/settings payloads, `DirectMessageService` exposes global notification toggles, `/api/social` privacy APIs are wired to the dashboard, React routes render the new surfaces, and Vitest + HTTP suites guard the new endpoints.
- Instructor dashboard aggregation is live: `buildInstructorDashboard` composes course progress, tutor pipelines, live classroom schedules, asset/ebook performance, community monetisation, ads experiments, and subscription revenue while `DashboardService.getDashboardForUser` merges the instructor payload, expands profile stats/bio, and appends search index entries. Vitest service + HTTP suites now validate instructor metrics and contract delivery, unlocking Task 5.3 frontend integration.
- Instructor monetisation hub is operational in React: `/dashboard/instructor/pricing` renders course offer funnels, subscription tiers, live-session pricing, revenue mix progress bars, and insight callouts by consuming the new `dashboard.pricing` payload with normalised metrics, linted data parsing, and navigation/search integration aligned to `dashboard_drawings.md`, `menu_drawings.md`, and `Application_Design_Update_Plan/Application Design Update.md`.
- Admin control center now ships the operational console: the React `/admin` route consumes the new `/api/admin/console` snapshot to present approvals, incident bridges, refund audits, support backlog, and policy updates with live metrics, severity badges, SLA cues, and feature-flag governance aligned to `Admin_panel_drawings.md`, `dashboard_drawings.md`, and runtime configuration contracts. Documentation, database change logs, design trackers, and QA notes have been updated to mirror the production payloads, migration, seeds, OpenAPI schemas, and Vitest suites backing the console so downstream teams have a single source of truth.
- Admin operational console iteration now adds runtime-driven policy governance, CSV export, and admin invite tooling: React `/admin` consumes `/api/dashboard/me` admin aggregates to present KPI tiles, approvals queues, payment health breakdowns, support/risk/platform stats, policy hub CTAs, operational alerts, and analytics shortcuts with feature-flag gating. The UI mirrors `Admin_panel_drawings.md`, `dashboard_drawings.md`, `menu_drawings.md`, and runtime configuration docs so operations teams can triage incidents and policy reviews without leaving the console.
- Identity verification is now production ready across backend and frontend: the new KYC tables, seeds, and service layer power presigned uploads, checksum validation, audit logging, and admin review flows. Learner and instructor dashboards surface live verification progress with self-service uploads, while the admin compliance queue exposes risk controls, SLA tracking, and review actions tied to audit trails and OpenAPI documentation.
