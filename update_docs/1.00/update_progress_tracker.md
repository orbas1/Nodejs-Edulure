# Version 1.00 Progress Tracker

Progress is tracked per task with percentage measures for security, completion, integration, functionality, error-free readiness, production readiness, and an overall average (mean of the prior six metrics).

| Task | Security Level | Completion Level | Integration Level | Functionality Level | Error-Free Level | Production Level | Overall Level |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Task 1 – Platform Hardening & Governance Foundations | 92% | 88% | 85% | 88% | 89% | 88% | 88% |
| Task 2 – Content, Commerce & Live Learning Delivery | 78% | 82% | 80% | 83% | 72% | 74% | 78% |
| Task 3 – Communities, Social Graph & Engagement Systems | 0% | 0% | 0% | 0% | 0% | 0% | 0% |
| Task 4 – Explorer Search, Ads & Intelligence Platform | 0% | 0% | 0% | 0% | 0% | 0% | 0% |
| Task 5 – Dashboards, Profiles & Operational Consoles | 0% | 0% | 0% | 0% | 0% | 0% | 0% |
| Task 6 – Mobile Parity & Store Readiness | 0% | 0% | 0% | 0% | 0% | 0% | 0% |
| Task 7 – Quality Assurance, Policies & Launch Operations | 0% | 0% | 0% | 0% | 0% | 0% | 0% |

**Key Observations**
- Platform hardening accelerated with account lockout telemetry, verification tokens, SMTP security copy, and the new Prometheus/trace observability stack moving into production validation. Session rotation/log-out tooling with cached validation now shields revoked tokens across web and mobile clients.
- Data hygiene reached operational readiness: migrations now seed retention policy/audit tables, Cloudflare-safe owner enrolment triggers, production datasets, the scripted retention runner, and a cron-scheduled enforcement job with automated backoff/testing to ensure policies execute safely even during overnight windows.
- Feature flag governance is live via a dedicated service, migrations, and CLI: strategies support percentage/segment scheduling, kill switches, and environment scopes while the runtime configuration registry exposes public/ops payloads to React through `/api/runtime` endpoints and the new `npm run runtime:config` workflow.
- Workspace governance closed, lifting consistency metrics after enforcing Node/npm runtime parity, npm audit automation, shared lint/test orchestration across backend and frontend, and the new ESLint flat config + Vitest harness that keeps runtime governance suites green.
- Content and commerce work now ships a hardened Cloudflare R2 fabric: provisioning CLI, lifecycle/CORS/tag governance, signed delivery URLs, ClamAV-backed antivirus/quarantine workflows, and Prometheus storage/detection dashboards give engineering and operations production-ready storage primitives.
- Payments and commerce stack is live: Stripe/PayPal orchestration, tax and coupon engines, refund/capture workflows, webhook signature validation, Prometheus counters, and seeded finance fixtures are in production review with docs mirroring API contracts and the React checkout funnel ready for QA.
- Commerce Vitest harness requires a transactional Knex stub update for the new order number helper; test failures are captured in build notes and queued for the next sprint.
- Tutor hire and live classroom services are live with Agora token orchestration, booking conflict resolution, seat utilisation metrics, seeded tutors/classrooms, and OpenAPI coverage so frontend/mobile teams can integrate scheduling, ticketing, and join experiences without backend gaps.
- Social, explorer, dashboard, mobile, and QA programmes await foundational dependencies; progress is intentionally gated until upstream services stabilise.

### Design Progress Addendum
| Metric | Current Score (%) | Commentary |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Design Quality | 78 | Live classroom and commerce checkout specs are annotated across `dashboard_drawings.md`, `website_drawings.md`, and `App_screens_drawings.md`, covering payment, refund, and receipt states alongside booking flows. |
| Design Organisation | 74 | IA overlays link tutor rosters, classroom calendars, and payments IA (checkout, receipts, admin finance) using `menu_drawings.md` and `Organisation_and_positions.md`. |
| Design Position | 70 | Multi-column layouts balance stream panels, roster drawers, checkout summary rails, and legal disclosures without clipping responsive breakpoints mapped in `Screen Size Changes.md`. |
| Design Text Grade | 70 | Copy decks include tutor booking guardrails, Agora states, payment confirmation/dispute copy, and VAT messaging referencing `Screen_text.md` and `text.md.md`. |
| Design Colour Grade | 75 | Engagement tokens extend to payment method tiles, finance alerts, and live session badges while preserving WCAG ratios logged in `Screen_update_Screen_colours.md`. |
| Design Render Grade | 64 | High-fidelity renders added for classroom lobby, streaming, tutor storefronts, checkout forms, and receipt dashboards. |
| Compliance Grade | 76 | Ticketing, cancellation, PCI disclosures, and refund prompts align with legal requirements captured in `Admin_panel_drawings.md`. |
| Security Grade | 84 | Join and checkout flows surface verification badges, secure payment notices, and webhook health messaging mirroring backend enforcement. |
| Design Functionality Grade | 70 | Interaction specs capture booking conflicts, waitlists, coupon/tax application, payment retries, and seat limit adjustments. |
| Design Images Grade | 66 | Asset manifests expanded with tutor photography, classroom illustrations, payment method art, and finance iconography. |
| Design Usability Grade | 66 | Walkthroughs validated scheduling heuristics, checkout completion, and refund requests with research participants. |
| Bugs-Less Grade | 56 | Peer review closed layout regressions for calendar overlays and checkout summary rails; outstanding motion refinements tracked. |
| Test Grade | 62 | Regression suite covers booking calendar edge cases, checkout validation states, live lobby states, and chat overlays across breakpoints. |
| QA Grade | 64 | QA checklist extends to tutor onboarding, live class moderation, Stripe/PayPal smoke tests, and webhook monitoring. |
| Design Accuracy Grade | 66 | Measurements and token usage validated for agenda rails, roster drawers, order recap cards, and attendee chips across device sizes. |
| Overall Grade | 74 | Live classroom and commerce experiences reach production readiness with balanced scheduling, billing, and compliance treatments; motion polish remains planned. |
