# Version 1.00 Progress Tracker

Progress is tracked per task with percentage measures for security, completion, integration, functionality, error-free readiness, production readiness, and an overall average (mean of the prior six metrics).

| Task | Security Level | Completion Level | Integration Level | Functionality Level | Error-Free Level | Production Level | Overall Level |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Task 1 – Platform Hardening & Governance Foundations | 92% | 88% | 85% | 88% | 89% | 88% | 88% |
| Task 2 – Content, Commerce & Live Learning Delivery | 74% | 82% | 80% | 84% | 72% | 75% | 78% |
| Task 3 – Communities, Social Graph & Engagement Systems | 0% | 0% | 0% | 0% | 0% | 0% | 0% |
| Task 4 – Explorer Search, Ads & Intelligence Platform | 0% | 0% | 0% | 0% | 0% | 0% | 0% |
| Task 5 – Dashboards, Profiles & Operational Consoles | 0% | 0% | 0% | 0% | 0% | 0% | 0% |
| Task 6 – Mobile Parity & Store Readiness | 0% | 0% | 0% | 0% | 0% | 0% | 0% |
| Task 7 – Quality Assurance, Policies & Launch Operations | 0% | 0% | 0% | 0% | 0% | 0% | 0% |

**Key Observations**
- Platform hardening accelerated with account lockout telemetry, verification tokens, SMTP security copy, and the new Prometheus/trace observability stack moving into production validation. Session rotation/log-out tooling with cached validation now shields revoked tokens across web and mobile clients.
- Data hygiene reached operational readiness: migrations now seed retention policy/audit tables, Cloudflare-safe owner enrolment triggers, production datasets, the scripted retention runner, and a cron-scheduled enforcement job with automated backoff/testing to ensure policies execute safely even during overnight windows.
- Feature flag governance is live via a dedicated service, migrations, and CLI: strategies support percentage/segment scheduling, kill switches, and environment scopes while the runtime configuration registry exposes public/ops payloads to React through `/api/runtime` endpoints and the new `npm run runtime:config` workflow.
- Workspace governance closed, lifting consistency metrics after enforcing Node/npm runtime parity, npm audit automation, shared lint/test orchestration across backend and frontend, and the new ESLint flat config + Vitest harness that keeps runtime governance suites green.
- Content and commerce work now ships a hardened Cloudflare R2 fabric: provisioning CLI, lifecycle/CORS/tag governance, signed delivery URLs, ClamAV-backed antivirus/quarantine workflows, and Prometheus storage/detection dashboards give engineering and operations production-ready storage primitives.
- Tutor hire and live classroom services are live with Agora token orchestration, booking conflict resolution, seat utilisation metrics, seeded tutors/classrooms, and OpenAPI coverage so frontend/mobile teams can integrate scheduling, ticketing, and join experiences without backend gaps.
- Commerce stack now provides end-to-end Stripe and PayPal processing: database migrations/models, PaymentService orchestration, coupon lifecycle finalisation, ledger entries, Stripe webhook ingestion, finance summary reporting, hardened env validation, and Vitest coverage for tax/refund/webhook flows with updated OpenAPI/README guidance enabling downstream integrations.
- Social, explorer, dashboard, mobile, and QA programmes await foundational dependencies; progress is intentionally gated until upstream services stabilise.

### Design Progress Addendum
| Metric | Current Score (%) | Commentary |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Design Quality | 78 | Provider and learner commerce wireframes now outline coupon governance, webhook triage, dispute workflows, and learner receipts referencing `provider_app_wireframe_changes.md`, `user_app_wireframe_changes.md`, and `web_application_logic_flow_changes.md`. |
| Design Organisation | 72 | Finance IA overlays connect ledger exports, dispute kanban, and refund drawers with navigation cues sourced from `menu_drawings.md`, `website_drawings.md`, and `Design_Task_Plan_Upgrade/Web_Application_Design_Update/Web Application Design Update.md`. |
| Design Position | 68 | Multi-column layouts balance finance summaries, coupon inspectors, and webhook timelines without breaking responsive breakpoints. |
| Design Text Grade | 68 | Microcopy now covers refund eligibility, dispute escalation, PayPal fallback messaging, and SCA challenge guidance with localisation buffers tied to `Screen_text.md`. |
| Design Colour Grade | 74 | Engagement/status tokens extend to payment status badges, dispute severity markers, and webhook error highlights while preserving WCAG ratios. |
| Design Render Grade | 64 | High-fidelity renders added for checkout modals, payment confirmation, refund trackers, and provider finance dashboards aligning with updated wireframes. |
| Compliance Grade | 72 | PCI/legal messaging annotates refund approvals, ledger exports, and dispute escalations referencing `Admin_panel_drawings.md` and compliance runbooks. |
| Security Grade | 84 | Payment flows surface SCA state, webhook verification badges, and secure data notices mirroring backend enforcement across `payment.routes` specifications. |
| Design Functionality Grade | 70 | Interaction specs capture coupon limit enforcement, partial refunds, webhook retries, and dispute lifecycle automation. |
| Design Images Grade | 64 | Asset manifests expanded with finance icons, status illustrations, and receipt imagery ensuring parity across learner/provider experiences. |
| Design Usability Grade | 66 | Walkthroughs validated checkout, SCA, refund submission, and dispute collaboration heuristics with learner/provider finance cohorts. |
| Bugs-Less Grade | 56 | Peer review closed finance banner stacking issues and webhook timeline scroll clipping; outstanding motion refinements tracked. |
| Test Grade | 62 | Regression suite now covers checkout modals, payment confirmation states, refund drawer flows, and webhook alert rules across breakpoints. |
| QA Grade | 66 | QA checklist extended with coupon governance, refund SLA tracking, dispute timelines, and webhook replay acceptance criteria. |
| Design Accuracy Grade | 68 | Measurements and token usage validated for finance summary rails, coupon drawers, SCA modals, and dispute kanban columns across device matrices. |
| Overall Grade | 73 | Commerce and finance surfaces achieve production readiness with documented interactions, accessibility, and compliance coverage while motion polish continues in the next sprint. |
