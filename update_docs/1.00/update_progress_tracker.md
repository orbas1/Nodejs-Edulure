# Version 1.00 Progress Tracker

Progress is tracked per task with percentage measures for security, completion, integration, functionality, error-free readiness, production readiness, and an overall average (mean of the prior six metrics).

| Task | Security Level | Completion Level | Integration Level | Functionality Level | Error-Free Level | Production Level | Overall Level |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Task 1 – Platform Hardening & Governance Foundations | 92% | 88% | 85% | 88% | 89% | 88% | 88% |
| Task 2 – Content, Commerce & Live Learning Delivery | 74% | 82% | 80% | 84% | 72% | 75% | 78% |
| Task 3 – Communities, Social Graph & Engagement Systems | 28% | 20% | 26% | 30% | 24% | 25% | 26% |
| Task 4 – Explorer Search, Ads & Intelligence Platform | 0% | 0% | 0% | 0% | 0% | 0% | 0% |
| Task 5 – Dashboards, Profiles & Operational Consoles | 0% | 0% | 0% | 0% | 0% | 0% | 0% |
| Task 6 – Mobile Parity & Store Readiness | 0% | 0% | 0% | 0% | 0% | 0% | 0% |
| Task 7 – Quality Assurance, Policies & Launch Operations | 0% | 0% | 0% | 0% | 0% | 0% | 0% |

**Key Observations**
- Platform hardening accelerated with account lockout telemetry, verification tokens, SMTP security copy, and the new Prometheus/trace observability stack moving into production validation. Session rotation/log-out tooling with cached validation now shields revoked tokens across web and mobile clients.
- Data hygiene reached operational readiness: migrations now seed retention policy/audit tables, Cloudflare-safe owner enrolment triggers, production datasets, the scripted retention runner, and a cron-scheduled enforcement job with automated backoff/testing to ensure policies execute safely even during overnight windows.
- Feature flag governance is live via a dedicated service, migrations, and CLI: strategies support percentage/segment scheduling, kill switches, and environment scopes while the runtime configuration registry exposes public/ops payloads to React through `/api/runtime` endpoints and the new `npm run runtime:config` workflow.
- Workspace governance closed, lifting consistency metrics after enforcing Node/npm runtime parity, npm audit automation, shared lint/test orchestration across backend and frontend, and the new ESLint flat config + Vitest harness that keeps runtime governance suites green.
- Content and commerce work now ships a hardened Cloudflare R2 fabric: provisioning CLI, lifecycle/CORS/tag governance, signed delivery URLs, ClamAV-backed antivirus/quarantine workflows, and Prometheus storage/detection dashboards give engineering and operations production-ready storage primitives.
- Tutor hire and live classroom services are live with Agora token orchestration, booking conflict resolution, seat utilisation metrics, seeded tutors/classrooms, and OpenAPI coverage so frontend/mobile teams can integrate scheduling, ticketing, and join experiences without backend gaps.
- Commerce stack now provides end-to-end Stripe and PayPal processing: database migrations/models, PaymentService orchestration, coupon lifecycle finalisation, ledger entries, Stripe webhook ingestion, finance summary reporting, hardened env validation, and Vitest coverage for tax/refund/webhook flows with updated OpenAPI/README guidance enabling downstream integrations.
- Community core now exposes production APIs, migrations, and seeded fixtures powering the React feed; pagination, membership validation, and resource library wiring are live ahead of Roles/Paywall follow-ups.
- Social, explorer, dashboard, mobile, and QA programmes await foundational dependencies; progress is intentionally gated until upstream services stabilise.

### Design Progress Addendum
| Metric | Current Score (%) | Commentary |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Design Quality | 82 | Community hub and resource sidebar specifications now mirror `dashboard_drawings.md`, `website_drawings.md`, and `App_screens_drawings.md`, layering role badges, pagination controls, and accessibility cues over the commerce suite. |
| Design Organisation | 76 | Updated IA overlays connect community switching, feed detail, and resource curation to finance/admin flows using `menu_drawings.md`, `Admin_panel_drawings.md`, and `Design_Task_Plan_Upgrade/Web_Application_Design_Update/Web Application Design Update.md`. |
| Design Position | 70 | Layout guidance balances hero metrics, feed cards, and resource drawers across breakpoints, validated against `dashboard_drawings.md` and `menu_drawings.md`. |
| Design Text Grade | 70 | Copy decks now cover community moderation prompts, resource pagination helper text, and role guardrails referencing `Screen_text.md` and `Application_Design_Update_Plan/Application Design Update.md`. |
| Design Colour Grade | 74 | Engagement/status tokens extend to payment status badges, dispute markers, community visibility chips, and resource metadata tags while preserving WCAG ratios. |
| Design Render Grade | 68 | High-fidelity renders added for checkout modals, community profile summaries, resource drawers, and notification badges ready for handoff. |
| Compliance Grade | 75 | PCI/legal messaging remains aligned while private community access copy and escalation prompts map to `Admin_panel_drawings.md` and compliance runbooks. |
| Security Grade | 84 | Payment surfaces and community access shells surface SCA state, membership guards, and secure data notices mirroring backend enforcement. |
| Design Functionality Grade | 74 | Interaction specs capture community switching, feed refresh, resource pagination, coupon enforcement, and webhook retries to keep workflows in sync. |
| Design Images Grade | 68 | Asset manifests expanded with community emblems, role badges, and resource thumbnails ensuring parity across learner/provider experiences. |
| Design Usability Grade | 70 | Walkthroughs validated community switching, feed loading, checkout, SCA handling, and moderation heuristics with learner/provider cohorts. |
| Bugs-Less Grade | 62 | Peer review resolved finance banner stacking issues, webhook scroll clipping, and community drawer spacing; motion polish remains logged. |
| Test Grade | 66 | Regression suite now covers checkout modals, resource pagination states, feed loader fallbacks, and webhook alert rules across breakpoints. |
| QA Grade | 70 | QA checklist expanded with coupon governance, resource pagination QA, moderation prompts, and webhook replay acceptance criteria. |
| Design Accuracy Grade | 72 | Measurements validated for finance summary rails, community profile cards, resource drawers, and webhook feed cards across device matrices. |
| Overall Grade | 77 | Commerce and community surfaces achieve production readiness with documented interactions, accessibility, and compliance coverage while motion polish continues in the next sprint. |
