# Version 1.00 Progress Tracker

Progress is tracked per task with percentage measures for security, completion, integration, functionality, error-free readiness, production readiness, and an overall average (mean of the prior six metrics).

| Task | Security Level | Completion Level | Integration Level | Functionality Level | Error-Free Level | Production Level | Overall Level |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Task 1 – Platform Hardening & Governance Foundations | 92% | 88% | 85% | 88% | 89% | 88% | 88% |
| Task 2 – Content, Commerce & Live Learning Delivery | 68% | 64% | 63% | 66% | 58% | 59% | 63% |
| Task 3 – Communities, Social Graph & Engagement Systems | 0% | 0% | 0% | 0% | 0% | 0% | 0% |
| Task 4 – Explorer Search, Ads & Intelligence Platform | 0% | 0% | 0% | 0% | 0% | 0% | 0% |
| Task 5 – Dashboards, Profiles & Operational Consoles | 0% | 0% | 0% | 0% | 0% | 0% | 0% |
| Task 6 – Mobile Parity & Store Readiness | 0% | 0% | 0% | 0% | 0% | 0% | 0% |
| Task 7 – Quality Assurance, Policies & Launch Operations | 0% | 0% | 0% | 0% | 0% | 0% | 0% |

**Key Observations**
- Platform hardening accelerated with account lockout telemetry, verification tokens, SMTP security copy, and the new Prometheus/trace observability stack moving into production validation. Session rotation/log-out tooling with cached validation now shields revoked tokens across web and mobile clients.
- Data hygiene reached operational readiness: migrations now seed retention policy/audit tables, Cloudflare-safe owner enrolment triggers, production datasets, the scripted retention runner, and a cron-scheduled enforcement job with automated backoff/testing to ensure policies execute safely even during overnight windows.
- Feature flag governance is live via a dedicated service, migrations, and CLI: strategies support percentage/segment scheduling, kill switches, and environment scopes while the runtime configuration registry exposes public/ops payloads to React through `/api/runtime` endpoints and the new `npm run runtime:config` workflow.
- Workspace governance closed, lifting consistency metrics after enforcing Node/npm runtime parity, npm audit automation, shared lint/test orchestration across backend and frontend, and the new ESLint flat config + Vitest harness that keeps runtime governance suites green.
- Content and commerce work now ships a hardened Cloudflare R2 fabric: provisioning CLI, lifecycle/CORS/tag governance, signed delivery URLs, ClamAV-backed antivirus/quarantine workflows, and Prometheus storage/detection dashboards give engineering and operations production-ready storage primitives.
- Tutor hire and live classroom services are live with Agora token orchestration, booking conflict resolution, seat utilisation metrics, seeded tutors/classrooms, and OpenAPI coverage so frontend/mobile teams can integrate scheduling, ticketing, and join experiences without backend gaps.
- Social, explorer, dashboard, mobile, and QA programmes await foundational dependencies; progress is intentionally gated until upstream services stabilise.

### Design Progress Addendum
| Metric | Current Score (%) | Commentary |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Design Quality | 74 | Live classroom scheduling, tutor booking, and join states are annotated across web/admin/learner specs referencing `dashboard_drawings.md` and `App_screens_drawings.md`. |
| Design Organisation | 70 | IA overlays link tutor rosters, classroom calendars, and support escalation paths using `menu_drawings.md` and `website_drawings.md`. |
| Design Position | 66 | Multi-column layouts balance stream panels, roster drawers, and booking summary rails without clipping responsive breakpoints. |
| Design Text Grade | 66 | Copy decks cover tutor bios, booking guardrails, ticketing policies, and Agora connection states with localisation buffers. |
| Design Colour Grade | 74 | Engagement/status tokens extend to live session badges and availability pills while preserving WCAG ratios. |
| Design Render Grade | 58 | High-fidelity renders added for classroom lobby, session streaming, roster management, and tutor storefronts. |
| Compliance Grade | 70 | Ticketing, cancellation, and recording consent prompts align with policy/legal requirements captured in `Admin_panel_drawings.md`. |
| Security Grade | 82 | Join flows surface moderation badges, attendee verification cues, and secure token warnings matching backend enforcement. |
| Design Functionality Grade | 64 | Interaction specs capture booking conflicts, waitlists, live chat escalation, and seat limit adjustments. |
| Design Images Grade | 62 | Asset manifests expanded with tutor hero photography, classroom illustrations, and chat iconography. |
| Design Usability Grade | 60 | Walkthroughs validated scheduling heuristics, countdown timers, and post-class surveys with research participants. |
| Bugs-Less Grade | 52 | Peer review closed layout regressions for calendar overlays and streaming controls; outstanding motion refinements tracked. |
| Test Grade | 58 | Regression suite now covers booking calendar edge cases, live lobby states, and chat overlays across breakpoints. |
| QA Grade | 60 | QA checklist extended to tutor onboarding, live class moderation, and Agora token smoke tests. |
| Design Accuracy Grade | 62 | Measurements and token usage validated for agenda rails, roster drawers, and attendee chips across device sizes. |
| Overall Grade | 69 | Live classroom/tutor experiences reach production readiness with balanced scheduling, engagement, and compliance treatments; motion polish remains planned. |
