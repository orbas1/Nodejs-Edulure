## Notes & Next Steps
- Update metrics upon completion of milestone checkpoints and after QA sign-off for each deliverable.
- Task 1 security baseline is complete; circulate the OpenAPI specification and refreshed env requirements to front-end/mobile squads before Task 2 begins.
- Task 2 asset pipeline is code-complete with R2 provisioning, ingestion services, analytics reporting, and client integrations. Remaining follow-up is CloudConvert credential provisioning in staging (tracked with the 95% "Error Free" score).
- Maintain linkage to testing reports, beta feedback, and release documentation within Task 6 artefacts, starting with the published Version 1.10 testing plan.
- Coordinate Task 7 store submissions, crash monitoring configuration, and support playbooks with the release calendar.
- Track Task 8 design deliverables against the dedicated design milestone phases to ensure engineering receives production-ready specs before feature implementation kicks off.
