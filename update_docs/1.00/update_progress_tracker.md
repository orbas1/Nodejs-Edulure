# Version 1.00 Progress Tracker

Progress is tracked per task with percentage measures for security, completion, integration, functionality, error-free readiness, production readiness, and an overall average (mean of the prior six metrics).

| Task | Security Level | Completion Level | Integration Level | Functionality Level | Error-Free Level | Production Level | Overall Level |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Task 1 – Platform Hardening & Governance Foundations | 72% | 40% | 44% | 42% | 48% | 38% | 47% |
| Task 2 – Content, Commerce & Live Learning Delivery | 10% | 5% | 5% | 5% | 5% | 0% | 5% |
| Task 3 – Communities, Social Graph & Engagement Systems | 0% | 0% | 0% | 0% | 0% | 0% | 0% |
| Task 4 – Explorer Search, Ads & Intelligence Platform | 0% | 0% | 0% | 0% | 0% | 0% | 0% |
| Task 5 – Dashboards, Profiles & Operational Consoles | 0% | 0% | 0% | 0% | 0% | 0% | 0% |
| Task 6 – Mobile Parity & Store Readiness | 0% | 0% | 0% | 0% | 0% | 0% | 0% |
| Task 7 – Quality Assurance, Policies & Launch Operations | 0% | 0% | 0% | 0% | 0% | 0% | 0% |

**Key Observations**
- Platform hardening accelerated with account lockout telemetry, verification tokens, and SMTP security copy moving into production validation.
- Workspace governance closed, lifting consistency metrics after enforcing Node/npm runtime parity, npm audit automation, and shared lint/test orchestration across backend and frontend.
- Content and commerce work has initiated R2 scaffolding and live learning preparation but remains largely in design and prototyping.
- Social, explorer, dashboard, mobile, and QA programmes await foundational dependencies; progress is intentionally gated until upstream services stabilise.
