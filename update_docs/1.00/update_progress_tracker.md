## Version 1.00 Design Metrics Snapshot
The design-specific health metrics below align with `Design_update_progress_tracker.md` and highlight priority focus areas before final handoff.

| Metric | Score (%) | Commentary |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Design Quality | 68 | High-fidelity templates improving, but media viewer states need further iteration and validation. |
| Design Organisation | 72 | IA and component inventories are documented; cross-platform linkage requires refinement. |
| Design Position | 64 | Hero and campaign placements planned, yet seasonal takeover logic is unresolved. |
| Design Text Grade | 70 | Copy decks largely approved; compliance wording pending legal review. |
| Design Colour Grade | 75 | Token contrast validated; emo/seasonal overlays still undergoing regression checks. |
| Design Render Grade | 62 | Figma render quality is strong, but cross-platform spacing mismatches persist. |
| Compliance Grade | 66 | Privacy overlays drafted with annotation retention guidance outstanding. |
| Security Grade | 60 | Consent and notification defaults defined, requiring engineering confirmation on enforcement. |
| Design Functionality Grade | 63 | Core interactions mapped; advanced motion/offline behaviours incomplete. |
| Design Images Grade | 58 | Asset manifests remain partial and need final art direction approval. |
| Design Usability Grade | 69 | Navigation tests positive; monetisation/settings flows awaiting broader validation. |
| Bugs-Less Grade | 65 | Dark-mode icon inconsistencies and spacing issues identified by QA remain open. |
| Test Grade | 61 | Visual regression harness operational but limited for Flutter components. |
| QA Grade | 67 | QA checklist in progress and needs localisation/accessibility alignment. |
| Design Accuracy Grade | 70 | Most templates match tokens; legacy screens still reference deprecated styles. |
| Overall Grade | 66 | Foundational improvements evident with imagery, motion, and compliance areas still below target thresholds. |

## Notes & Next Steps
- Update metrics upon completion of milestone checkpoints and after QA sign-off for each deliverable.
- Task 1 security baseline is complete; circulate the OpenAPI specification and refreshed env requirements to front-end/mobile squads before Task 2 begins.
- Task 2 asset pipeline is code-complete with R2 provisioning, ingestion services, analytics reporting, and client integrations. Remaining follow-up is CloudConvert credential provisioning in staging (tracked with the 95% "Error Free" score).
- Maintain linkage to testing reports, beta feedback, and release documentation within Task 6 artefacts, starting with the published Version 1.10 testing plan.
- Coordinate Task 7 store submissions, crash monitoring configuration, and support playbooks with the release calendar.
- Track Task 8 design deliverables against the dedicated design milestone phases to ensure engineering receives production-ready specs before feature implementation kicks off.
