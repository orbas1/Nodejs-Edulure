# Version 1.00 Design Plan

## Vision & Experience Principles
1. **Unified Multi-Channel Identity:** Deliver a harmonised experience across responsive web, Flutter learner app, and future provider shells. Component tokens, imagery specs, and layout primitives are defined once and consumed everywhere.
2. **Themeable Foundations:** Establish a token-driven theming engine with support for default, high-contrast, and emo/seasonal palettes. All components must remain contrast-compliant when tokens shift.
3. **Task-Centred Workflows:** Prioritise quick task completion by collapsing navigation depth, exposing contextual actions, and surfacing progress signals in dashboards and home screens.
4. **Accessible-by-Design:** Bake in WCAG 2.2 AA conformance, reduced motion modes, and localisation flexibility from the component level upward.
5. **Analytics-Ready Layouts:** Instrument every major template with component IDs, event taxonomies, and data placeholders to support growth experiments and compliance logging.

## Scope of Work
- **Theming & Tokens:** Finalise the typography scale, palette sets, spacing values, and elevation tiers captured in `Application_Design_Update_Plan/Colours.md`, `Fonts.md`, and `Screen_update_Screen_colours.md`. Extend token schema to support emo/festival overlays and partial theme swaps for landing pages.
- **Navigation Refactor:** Adopt the cross-platform menu hierarchy defined in `Application_Design_Update_Plan/Menus.md` and `Web Application Design Update/Menus.md`. Introduce breadcrumb and stepper patterns (see `Logic_Flow_map.md`) for deep flows such as onboarding, package creation, and compliance reviews.
- **Homepage & Dashboard Redesign:** Implement the modular hero, progress, recommendation, and campaign blocks outlined in `Screens_Update.md`, `Home page components.md`, and `Dashboard Designs.md`. Provide alternate arrangements for learners, instructors, and admin roles with dynamic content slots.
- **Media & Resource Modules:** Rebuild content cards, forms, and resource drawers using `component_functions.md`, `Cards.md`, and `Forms.md`. Include inline states for conversion progress, offline cache, rights restrictions, and shared annotations.
- **Profile & Settings Suite:** Align profile styling (`Profile Styling.md`, `Organisation_and_positions.md`) with monetisation and verification modules. Reshape settings dashboards (`Settings Dashboard.md`, `Settings Screen.md`) to highlight privacy, notifications, and financial controls with inline help.
- **Responsive Behaviour:** Implement breakpoints and adaptive behaviours detailed in `Screen Size Changes.md` and `Organisation_and_positions.md`. Ensure widget stacking rules for tablets and large displays follow the updated responsive matrix.
- **Imagery & Motion Guidelines:** Standardise hero, dashboard, and carousel imagery specs plus permissible animation curves using `images_and_vectors.md` and `Screens_update_images_and_vectors.md`. Provide fallback treatments for low-bandwidth and reduced-motion preferences.
- **Content Governance:** Leverage `Dummy_Data_Requirements.md` and `Screen_text.md` to define placeholder copy, data fidelity expectations, and localisation strings for QA and analytics instrumentation.

## Deliverables
- **Design System Tokens & Documentation:** Updated Figma libraries, JSON token exports, and developer documentation covering colours, typography, spacing, elevation, and iconography.
- **Component Specification Pack:** Redlines, interaction notes, and component anatomy diagrams for navigation bars, cards, forms, hero modules, settings clusters, and modal patterns.
- **Flow Narratives:** Storyboards and journey maps for onboarding, content upload, community engagement, and monetisation flows referencing the logic flow artefacts.
- **Accessibility & Compliance Checklist:** Completed evaluation forms, screen reader scripts, localisation prototypes, and security/privacy content overlays.
- **Engineering Handoff Toolkit:** Annotated prototypes, motion references, asset package manifests, and analytics event matrices accessible via the design repository.

## Key Risks & Mitigations
| Risk | Impact | Mitigation |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Theming overrides break component contrast | Accessibility compliance failures during seasonal campaigns | Token-level contrast testing, automated diffing on theme updates, and design QA gating per `Screen_update_Screen_colours.md`. |
| Navigation restructuring confuses existing users | Increased support tickets and churn | Release tooltips, in-product tours, and progressive rollout across user cohorts. |
| Asset requirements strain marketing pipeline | Delays in seasonal hero launches | Maintain shared asset backlog, pre-render default packs, and include marketing in sprint demos referencing `images_and_vectors.md`. |
| Motion specs exceed engineering capacity | Delivery delays or inconsistent interactions | Prioritise motion tiers, provide CSS/Flutter code snippets, and limit advanced animations to hero modules in initial release. |
| Compliance copy not finalised | Launch blockers | Synchronise with legal/compliance weekly, track outstanding copy in Jira with due dates before engineering lock. |

## Approval & Governance
- **Design Steering Committee:** Bi-weekly review of token updates, layout patterns, and accessibility outcomes.
- **Change Control:** All modifications after freeze recorded in `Design_Change_log.md` and linked to Jira design tickets.
- **Engineering Alignment:** Weekly design-engineering sync to validate feasibility, surface technical constraints, and plan implementation sprints.
- **QA Readiness:** Dedicated QA design audits two sprints prior to release, leveraging templates from `update_progress_tracker.md`.
