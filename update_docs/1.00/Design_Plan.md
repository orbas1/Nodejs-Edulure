# Version 1.50 Design Plan

## Purpose & Scope
This plan consolidates the design intents extracted from the mobile Application Design Update Plan and the Web Application Design Update. It ensures that UI/UX deliverables are sequenced, governed, and handed off with parity across learner and provider surfaces. The scope covers navigation shells, media experiences, Communities 2.0, explorer, profile systems, and compliance-ready settings.

## Objectives
1. **Unify Component Language:** Deliver a shared design system (tokens, components, motion) that supports React web and Flutter mobile implementations without divergence.
2. **Embed New Feature Workstreams:** Translate Cloudflare R2 asset handling, Communities 2.0 mechanics, social graph elements, and explorer into consistent UI patterns.
3. **Guarantee Accessibility & Compliance:** Validate contrast, typography scaling, localisation, and regulatory touchpoints before engineering handoff.
4. **Reduce Implementation Ambiguity:** Provide annotated flows, redlines, and logic maps so engineering squads can deliver features without repeated clarification cycles.

## Deliverable Breakdown
### 1. Application (Flutter) Experience
- **Navigation & Shell:** Five-tab navigation with quick actions drawer, full-screen search overlay, and contextual floating action buttons mapped in `Screens_Update.md`.
- **Home & Dashboards:** Continue-learning carousels, community spotlight modules, provider analytics widgets, and offline-ready skeletons referencing `Screens_Update_Plan.md` and `Organisation_and_positions.md`.
- **Media Viewers:** Unified ebook and deck experiences with annotation entry points, offline states, and conversion progress banners referencing `Screens_Update_Logic_Flow.md` and `Screens_update_images_and_vectors.md`.
- **Content Library & Analytics:** Instructor dashboards showing upload status, DRM indicators, and analytics panels aligned to `Screens_update_images_and_vectors.md` and `Screens_Update.md` updates delivered for Task 2.
- **Communities 2.0:** Tier ladders, event calendars, chat dock, and moderation drawer using widget functions defined in `Screens_Updates_widget_functions.md`.
- **Settings & Notifications:** Monetisation, privacy, accessibility, and audit log tabs scoped in `Settings.md` and `Settings Screen.md` with microcopy guidelines.

### 2. Web Application Experience
- **Navigation & Shell:** Explorer-centric top navigation, workspace switcher, notifications hub, and global quick actions aligning with `Organisation_and_positions.md`.
- **Homepage:** Hero layout, continue-learning sections, and curated community tiles sourced from `Home Page Organisations.md` and `Home page images.md`.
- **Explorer:** Faceted filters, saved search chips, inline CTAs, and empty-state education referencing `Logic_Flow_update.md` and `component_functions.md`.
- **Content Administration:** Asset tables, analytics sidebars, and viewer overlays referencing the new Task 2 design drops (`Screens_Update.md`, `component_functions.md`) to ensure parity with the React experience.
- **Community Hub:** Announcement rail, event calendar, affiliate marketplace, and moderation drawer per `Dashboard Organisation.md` and `Placement.md`.
- **Profile & Settings:** Persona-aware modules from `Profile Look.md`, `Profile Styling.md`, and compliance-first settings within `Settings Dashboard.md`.

### 3. Shared Foundations
- **Design Tokens:** Colour, typography, spacing, and elevation palettes codified in `Colours.md`, `Fonts.md`, and `Scss.md` for import into component libraries.
- **Logic & Flow Maps:** Navigation logic, error handling, and offline states documented in `Logic_Flow_map.md`, `Logic_Flow_update.md`, and `Screens_Update_Logic_Flow_map.md`.
- **Data & Analytics Hooks:** Dummy data and analytics IDs mapped in `Dummy_Data_Requirements.md` and `component_functions.md` to support instrumentation.
- **Security & Compliance States:** Error and friction patterns for rate limiting, password guidance, and policy acknowledgements captured in `Error_states.md` and aligned with the new backend hardening.

## Governance & Collaboration
- **Design Crits:** Weekly cross-platform critique to vet component usage and ensure parity.
- **Engineering Alignment:** Bi-weekly sync with React and Flutter leads to validate feasibility, identify performance risks, and document handoff blockers.
- **Content & Compliance Reviews:** Copy reviews and regulatory sign-off sessions to validate moderation, monetisation, and privacy messaging.
- **Design Ops:** Maintain version-controlled Figma libraries with release notes, publish Zeplin/ZeroHeight documentation, and track requests via the design backlog.

## Timeline & Checkpoints
1. **Discovery (Week 1–2):** Validate prototypes with representative learners/providers; capture usability notes and iterate on layout density.
2. **System Finalisation (Week 3–4):** Lock tokens, iconography, and responsive grid rules; baseline accessibility metrics.
3. **Feature Detailing (Week 5–6):** Finalise screens for home, explorer, communities, profiles, settings, and the Cloudflare R2 content lifecycle; produce state charts and microcopy packs.
4. **Quality Gate (Week 7):** Run accessibility audits, localisation reviews, and responsive regression against reference breakpoints, including dark/light reader themes and offline-first messaging.
5. **Engineering Handoff (Week 8):** Deliver redlines, interaction specs, Zeplin exports, and track outstanding questions in Jira.

## Risks & Mitigations
- **Token Drift Between Platforms:** Mitigation – lock tokens in a shared library, enforce linting in design QA, and schedule mid-sprint audits.
- **Late Feature Scope Changes:** Mitigation – maintain change log, involve product owners in crits, and budget contingency buffer for rework.
- **Accessibility Debt:** Mitigation – run early audits, use automated tooling, and include accessibility tasks in engineering definition of done.
- **Telemetry Ambiguity:** Mitigation – document analytics IDs within component specs and review with Data Engineering before handoff.

## Success Measures
- Reduction of implementation questions logged by engineering squads by 40% compared with Version 1.40 release.
- Fewer than five accessibility defects identified during QA for redesigned surfaces.
- Positive stakeholder feedback (≥4/5 satisfaction) from learner/provider usability testing.
- All shared components shipped with telemetry instrumentation mapped during design.
