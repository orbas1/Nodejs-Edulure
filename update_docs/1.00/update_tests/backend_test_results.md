# Backend Test Results – Version 1.00

- `npm test` (backend-nodejs) — **failed**. Vitest aborted most suites because the runner could not resolve common ESM dependencies (`supertest`, `knex`, `dotenv`, `pino`, `slugify`, `node-cron`, `on-finished`, etc.) in this container, so HTTP and integration harnesses never executed. The new provider transition service/http route specs compiled before the dependency errors surfaced. 【e202c8†L1-L118】
- `npm --prefix backend-nodejs test` — **failed**. The end-to-end Vitest run exercised 60 files but eight suites failed due to environment dependencies (missing seeded dates, MySQL connectivity, and CloudConvert/provider transition mocks) and schema assertions that expect live fixtures. 【225b80†L1-L175】
- `npm --prefix backend-nodejs test -- environmentParity` — **passed**. Focused Vitest target exercising the new environment parity service and HTTP route confirms the manifest hashing logic and controller wiring behave under mocked infrastructure dependencies. 【1ce85a†L1-L8】
- `npm --workspace backend-nodejs run test:release` — **passed**. Release readiness Vitest suite exercised readiness metadata, security headers, and short-burst load probes against the `/health` pipeline using mocked database connections. 【327711†L1-L138】
- `npm --prefix backend-nodejs test -- securityOperations` — **passed**. Targeted Vitest run covering the new security operations service and HTTP routes validated scoring logic, CDC/audit side effects, and API envelopes without requiring external dependencies. 【9ab4f8†L1-L126】
