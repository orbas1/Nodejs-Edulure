# Database Change Log â€“ Version 1.50 Task 2

- Created `content_assets`, `asset_ingestion_jobs`, `asset_conversion_outputs`, `content_audit_logs`, `content_asset_events`, and `ebook_read_progress` tables via migration `20241020130000_content_assets.js`.
- Added indexes on asset status/type, ingestion job status, and content event occurrence timestamps to support analytics and worker efficiency.
- Extended existing migrations to ensure timestamps default to `CURRENT_TIMESTAMP` with update triggers for new content tables.
- Added data hygiene migration `20241105153000_data_hygiene.js` introducing `data_retention_policies`, `data_retention_audit_logs`, soft-delete columns, and community owner membership triggers aligned with compliance requirements.
- Provisioned feature flag, feature flag audit, and configuration tables to support runtime governance with environment-scoped entries and seed data.
