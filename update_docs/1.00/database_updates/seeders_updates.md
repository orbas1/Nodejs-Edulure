# Seeders Updates

- Added `backend-nodejs/seeds/001_bootstrap.js` seeding verified admin/instructor/learner accounts, dual communities with trigger-driven owner enrolment, asset lifecycle telemetry, ebook progress, domain events, and active vs stale sessions to exercise governance flows and retention policies.
- Seeder now provisions feature flag definitions, audit history, and runtime configuration entries (support contact, admin escalation channels, live classroom ceilings) so QA environments mirror production governance.
- Seeder expanded with curriculum, ebook, tutor, live classroom, and ads intelligence fixtures that map 1:1 with the new Meilisearch indexes. Courses include module/lesson/assignment hierarchies plus enrolments/progress, ebooks ship highlights/bookmarks/watermark events, tutors expose availability and bookings, live classrooms feature schedules/registrations, and ads campaigns include creatives, budget pacing, and conversion metrics to validate explorer ingestion pipelines.
- Seeder now preloads admin/support operations data: support tickets across billing/compliance/incident categories (with SLA clocks, latest events, and CSAT scores), pending admin review requests with urgency flags, live incident reports with severity/channel metadata, policy documents with review dates, and pending refunds to exercise the admin console queues under Vitest. This dataset keeps staging/QA environments aligned with the `/api/admin/console` analytics surfaced in React.
