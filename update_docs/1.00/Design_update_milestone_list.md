# Version 1.00 Design Update Milestones

## Milestone 1 – Token & Theme System Finalisation (Target: Week 2, Status: 70% complete)
- **Objectives:** Finalise cross-platform colour, typography, spacing, and motion tokens; document emo/seasonal overlays and partial page theme logic.
- **Entry Criteria:** Brand steering approval, accessibility baseline, and engineering agreement on token ingestion format.
- **Exit Criteria:** Token exports (CSS/JSON/Flutter) published, automated contrast checks executed, seasonal asset guardrails signed off, documentation refreshed in `Design_Plan.md`.
- **Dependencies:** Access to design libraries, colour/typography artefacts (`Colours.md`, `Fonts.md`), QA automation scripts.
- **Responsible Roles:** Principal Product Designer, Design Systems Engineer.

## Milestone 2 – Navigation & Layout Blueprint (Target: Week 4, Status: 45% complete)
- **Objectives:** Approve role-based navigation schema, IA labels, and responsive layout matrices across home, dashboard, and settings templates.
- **Entry Criteria:** Milestone 1 complete, updated journey maps, analytics and research insights.
- **Exit Criteria:** Interaction specs for menus, breadcrumbs, quick actions, and steppers published; breakpoint matrix validated; logic flow diagrams updated.
- **Dependencies:** IA research, logic flow artefacts (`Logic_Flow_map.md`, `Screens_Update_Logic_Flow_map.md`).
- **Responsible Roles:** UX Architect, Frontend Lead, Flutter Lead.

## Milestone 3 – Template & Component Delivery (Target: Week 6, Status: 30% complete)
- **Objectives:** Produce annotated high-fidelity templates for home, dashboards, explorer, media viewers, profiles, and settings across web and Flutter.
- **Entry Criteria:** Milestones 1–2 delivered; component inventory baselined.
- **Exit Criteria:** Templates annotated with states and analytics IDs, asset manifests produced, copy decks approved, usability validation recorded.
- **Dependencies:** Token library, imagery guidance (`images_and_vectors.md`), microcopy drafts (`Screen_text.md`).
- **Responsible Roles:** Product Designers, Content Strategist, QA Design Lead.

## Milestone 4 – Engineering Handoff & QA (Target: Week 8, Status: 10% complete)
- **Objectives:** Package design specifications, motion references, analytics matrices, and QA scripts; oversee accessibility, localisation, and compliance verification.
- **Entry Criteria:** Milestone 3 assets complete; engineering squads aligned on development sprints.
- **Exit Criteria:** Handoff checklist signed, accessibility/localisation scripts executed, design QA sign-off recorded, open issues logged in `Design_Change_log.md`.
- **Notes:** JWT key rotation hardening reviewed with engineering; no component updates required but documentation cross-check added to QA checklist. Workspace runtime enforcement was reviewed to guarantee Storybook exports run on the approved Node/npm versions before handoff. Verification and lockout copy now mirrors backend enforcement ahead of handoff.
- **Dependencies:** Engineering schedules, QA tooling, localisation resources, compliance checklists.
- **Responsible Roles:** Design Producer, Engineering Managers, Accessibility Specialist.
