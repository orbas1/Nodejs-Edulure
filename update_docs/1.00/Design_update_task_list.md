# Version 1.00 Design Update Task List

## Task 1 – Token & Theme System Completion (Status: 70%)
- **Objective:** Finalise reusable design tokens supporting default, high-contrast, and emo/seasonal themes across platforms.
- **Subtasks:**
  1. Audit existing palettes and typography scales against `Colours.md`, `Fonts.md`, and `Screen_update_Screen_colours.md`.
  2. Produce CSS/JSON/Flutter token exports with naming conventions mapped to React and Flutter variables.
  3. Validate contrast, motion, and accessibility states via automated scripts and manual hero/button spot checks.
  4. Document theme override workflows for partial page takeovers, seasonal packs, and landing-page variants.
  5. Run engineering ingestion rehearsal and capture regression diffs for colour, spacing, and elevation tokens.

## Task 2 – Navigation & Layout Architecture (Status: 45%)
- **Objective:** Deliver cross-platform navigation schemas, IA labels, and responsive layout rules.
- **Subtasks:**
  1. Consolidate learner, instructor, and admin menu structures from `Menus.md` and `Organisation_and_positions.md`.
  2. Map end-to-end journeys using `Logic_Flow_map.md`, `Screens_Update_Logic_Flow.md`, and `Screens_Update_Logic_Flow_map.md`.
  3. Prototype breadcrumb, stepper, and quick-action variants for deep workflows (onboarding, compliance, monetisation).
  4. Define breakpoint behaviours, grid adjustments, and widget stacking rules per `Placement.md` and `Screen Size Changes.md`.
  5. Facilitate usability validation sessions and integrate analytics instrumentation feedback.
  6. Publish final IA documentation, component IDs, and rollout guidance to engineering and product operations.

## Task 3 – Template & Component Production (Status: 30%)
- **Objective:** Produce annotated high-fidelity templates for priority experiences.
- **Subtasks:**
  1. Build home and dashboard compositions incorporating hero, progress, campaign, and insight modules (`Screens_Update.md`, `Dashboard Designs.md`).
  2. Redline media viewer states covering loading, offline, rights-restricted, and annotation flows (`component_functions.md`).
  3. Update profile and settings templates with monetisation, verification, and compliance modules (`Profile Styling.md`, `Settings Dashboard.md`).
  4. Specify card, form, and modal components including error/empty states and data placeholders (`Cards.md`, `Forms.md`).
  5. Assemble imagery specifications and asset manifests referencing `images_and_vectors.md` and `Screens_update_images_and _vectors.md`.
  6. Create copy decks and localisation placeholders with compliance review loops (`Screen_text.md`, `text.md.md`).
  7. Conduct peer reviews with engineering/QA and integrate feedback prior to milestone acceptance.

## Task 4 – Accessibility, Compliance & Handoff (Status: 20%)
- **Objective:** Ensure the design package is implementation-ready, compliant, and QA backed.
- **Subtasks:**
  1. Execute accessibility audits (contrast, keyboard, screen reader) on updated templates and navigation patterns.
  2. Validate localisation placeholders, RTL mirroring, and translation length buffers across high-priority screens.
  3. Compile security/privacy overlays for settings, payments, verification, consent prompts, and reinforce key rotation messaging aligned with backend JWT lifecycle. _Update:_ Email verification and lockout copy aligned with new backend flows; remaining work focuses on retention messaging.
  4. Produce engineering handoff kits with specs, interaction recordings, analytics matrices, and asset manifests, verifying Storybook/token pipelines run on the workspace-enforced Node/npm versions and aligning telemetry overlays with the new backend metrics feed.
  5. Host design QA walkthroughs with frontend, Flutter, and QA squads; triage outstanding questions.
  6. Log change requests and risk notes in `Design_Change_log.md` with Jira owners and due dates.
  7. Track readiness checklists and sign-offs from compliance, product, and engineering stakeholders.

## Task 5 – Theme Deployment & Runtime Validation (Status: 15%)
- **Objective:** Verify theme switching, partial deployments, and runtime performance across web and Flutter implementations.
- **Subtasks:**
  1. Build prototype theme switchers in Storybook/Figma to test default, emo, and seasonal packs against major templates.
  2. Validate partial theme overrides (homepage hero, community microsites) using `pages.md` configurations and token diffing.
  3. Coordinate with engineering to wire runtime theme payloads and collect telemetry on switch frequency and performance.
  4. Execute cross-platform regression sweeps ensuring WCAG compliance, asset alignment, and motion preferences persist.
  5. Document incident response and rollback procedures for theme deployment issues.
