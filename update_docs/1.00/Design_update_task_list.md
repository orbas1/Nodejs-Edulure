# Version 1.00 Design Update Task List

## Task 1 – Token & Theme System Completion
- **Objective:** Finalise reusable design tokens supporting default, high-contrast, and emo/seasonal themes across platforms.
- **Subtasks:**
  1. Audit existing palettes and typography scales against `Colours.md` and `Fonts.md` guidance.
  2. Produce JSON token exports with naming conventions mapped to Flutter and React variables.
  3. Validate contrast and accessibility using automated tooling and manual spot checks on hero/button states.
  4. Document theme override workflows, including seasonal packs and landing-page partial themes.
  5. Coordinate with engineering to schedule token ingestion and regression monitoring.

## Task 2 – Navigation & Layout Architecture
- **Objective:** Deliver cross-platform navigation schemas, IA labels, and responsive layout rules.
- **Subtasks:**
  1. Consolidate learner, instructor, and admin menu structures from `Menus.md` references.
  2. Map journeys and decision points using `Logic_Flow_map.md` and `Logic_Flow_update.md` artefacts.
  3. Prototype breadcrumb, stepper, and quick-action variants for complex flows.
  4. Define breakpoint behaviours and grid adjustments per `Organisation_and_positions.md` and `Screen Size Changes.md`.
  5. Run usability validation with representative personas and document findings.
  6. Publish final IA documentation and component IDs to analytics/engineering teams.

## Task 3 – Template & Component Production
- **Objective:** Produce annotated high-fidelity templates for priority experiences.
- **Subtasks:**
  1. Build home and dashboard compositions incorporating hero, progress, campaign, and insight modules.
  2. Redline media viewer states covering loading, offline, rights restricted, and annotation flows.
  3. Update profile and settings templates with monetisation, verification, and compliance sections.
  4. Specify card, form, and modal components including empty/error states and data placeholders.
  5. Assemble imagery specifications and asset manifests referencing `images_and_vectors.md`.
  6. Create copy decks and microcopy guidelines for home, forms, and settings views.
  7. Conduct peer reviews and integrate feedback prior to milestone handoff.

## Task 4 – Accessibility, Compliance, and Handoff
- **Objective:** Ensure the design package is implementation-ready, compliant, and QA backed.
- **Subtasks:**
  1. Execute accessibility audits (contrast, keyboard, screen reader) on final templates.
  2. Validate localisation placeholders, RTL layouts, and translation length buffers.
  3. Compile security/privacy overlays for settings, consent prompts, and notifications.
  4. Produce engineering handoff kits with specs, interaction videos, and analytics matrices.
  5. Host design QA sessions with frontend/Flutter squads to resolve open questions.
  6. Log remaining change requests in `Design_Change_log.md` and assign Jira owners.
  7. Capture final approvals from compliance, product, and engineering stakeholders.
