  1. Execute accessibility audits (contrast, keyboard, screen reader) on updated templates and navigation patterns. _Update:_ Community switcher and resource pagination controls now carry focus-visible guidance, disabled states, and aria labelling aligned to `menu_drawings.md`, `website_drawings.md`, and `Screen_text.md`.
  2. Validate localisation placeholders, RTL mirroring, and translation length buffers across high-priority screens.
  3. Compile security/privacy overlays for settings, payments, verification, consent prompts, and reinforce key rotation messaging aligned with backend JWT lifecycle. _Update:_ Email verification, lockout copy, antivirus/quarantine alerts, session governance (active devices, revoke-all confirmation), retention/audit banners, scheduler status/backoff chips, recording consent notices, tutor payout readiness steps, live class moderation prompts, checkout/refund compliance copy (PCI scopes, fraud escalation, PayPal dispute links), community chat safety tooltips (report, hide, delete), DM export notices, presence TTL disclosures, and the learner privacy centre (notification hub, follower approvals, DM alert toggles mapped to `/api/social/privacy` and `/api/chat/threads/preferences/notifications`) now mirror backend enforcement.
  4. Produce engineering handoff kits with specs, interaction recordings, analytics matrices, and asset manifests, verifying Storybook/token pipelines run on the workspace-enforced Node/npm versions and aligning telemetry overlays with the new backend metrics feed.
  5. Host design QA walkthroughs with frontend, Flutter, and QA squads; triage outstanding questions. _Update:_ Messaging QA packs now include chat pagination regression matrices, DM attachment audit flows, presence refresh cadence checks, and unread badge visual baselines referencing `dashboard_drawings.md`, `menu_drawings.md`, `App_screens_drawings.md`, and `Admin_panel_drawings.md`.
