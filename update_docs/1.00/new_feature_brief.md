- Search insights: dashboards for query volume, conversion funnels, zero-result tracking, and personalised recommendations.

## Architecture Considerations
- **Service Boundaries:** Define microservice contracts for storage, search, social, community, and profile modules with shared identity and notification services.
- **Data Migration:** Execute staged migrations for assets (to R2) and relational changes (profiles, communities) using feature flags and shadow writes.
- **API Evolution:** Adopt versioned REST/GraphQL endpoints, maintain backwards compatibility for existing mobile apps, and document new schemas.
- **Security & Compliance:** Enforce least-privilege IAM roles, encrypt data in transit/at rest, and run penetration tests on new community features.
- **Scalability:** Introduce caching (Redis/Cloudflare KV), background workers for heavy processing (PowerPoint conversion, search indexing), and autoscaling policies.

## Success Metrics
- 99%+ availability and <250ms median latency for R2-served assets across priority geographies.
- 30% increase in lesson completion rate for modules enriched with PowerPoints or enhanced ebooks.
- 25% growth in active follower connections and community engagement (posts, replies, chat messages) within 60 days of launch.
- 40% reduction in support tickets related to profile management, content playback, or asset access.
- <300ms average search latency, <2% zero-result queries, and measurable conversion lift from explorer interactions.
- Net Promoter Score (NPS) uplift of +8 points among instructors post-release.

## Dependencies & Risks
- Requires tight coordination across backend, frontend, mobile, DevOps, design, and QA squads to maintain feature parity.
- Asset migration risk mitigated via dual-write period, checksum verification, and staged cutovers.
- Meilisearch relevance tuning may demand iterative refinement; plan for experimentation and rapid index replays.
- Community overhaul introduces complex moderation and monetisation logic—dedicated threat modelling and legal review needed.
- Mobile parity depends on timely API stabilisation; incorporate buffer for SDK updates and app store submission cycles.

## Rollout & Change Management
1. **Internal Enablement:** Conduct training sessions and documentation updates for instructors, community managers, and support teams.
2. **Beta Phases:** Launch staged beta (staff → instructor champions → select learners) with feedback loops, surveys, and telemetry review.
3. **Marketing & Communication:** Prepare release notes, launch blogs, tutorial videos, and in-product walkthroughs spotlighting key features.
4. **Launch Control:** Use feature flags for R2 delivery, following, community modules, and explorer to enable gradual rollout and quick rollback.
5. **Post-Launch Monitoring:** Instrument dashboards for adoption, error rates, community health, and search performance; schedule weekly triage.
6. **Continuous Improvement:** Maintain backlog of enhancements gathered during beta/post-launch, prioritise in Version 1.51+ roadmaps.
