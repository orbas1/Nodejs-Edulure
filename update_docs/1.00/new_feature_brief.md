# Version 1.00 Feature Brief – Edulure Full Ecosystem Release

## Executive Summary
Version 1.00 transforms Edulure into an always-on learning, commerce, and community operating system that is available on web and Flutter. The update consolidates storage on Cloudflare R2, modernises course and ebook delivery with PowerPoint and interactive readers, unlocks a Skool-class social layer with communities and follower graphs, and equips explorers and admins with Meilisearch-powered discovery. Every surface—from instructor dashboards to learner mobile screens—is rebuilt as modular components that can evolve rapidly without regressions.

## Strategic Objectives
1. **Unified Content & Storage Fabric** – Migrate media, documents, and recordings to Cloudflare R2 with lifecycle automation, antivirus scans, and signed URL delivery for secure global performance.
2. **Immersive Learning Modalities** – Deliver componentised PowerPoint viewers, upgraded ebook readers, and live classrooms that work seamlessly across browsers and phones.
3. **High-Retention Social Graph** – Activate follow relationships, recommendations, and notifications that drive learners back into the ecosystem daily.
4. **Communities-as-a-Platform** – Redesign the community hub to rival Skool with role-based governance, paywalls, affiliate marketplaces, chat upgrades, and admin oversight on web and mobile.
5. **Explorer & Intelligence** – Launch a Meilisearch-backed explorer that unifies search across communities, courses, ebooks, tutors, profiles, and ads with analytics instrumentation.
6. **Component-Based Experiences** – Rebuild the profile area and dashboards as reusable components with complete backend, frontend, styling, and mobile parity.

## Stakeholder Value Proposition
| Persona | Critical Pain Today | Value Delivered in v1.00 |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Learner / Student** | Fragmented content types, no single feed, poor discovery, basic ebook reader. | PowerPoint playback, upgraded ebook reader, personal feed, explorer search, follower-based recommendations, Flutter parity. |
| **Instructor / Community Owner** | Disconnected tools for courses, communities, and monetisation. | Component-based profile, community management console, subscription tiers, affiliate marketplace, analytics dashboards, R2 asset workflows. |
| **Community Manager / Moderator** | Limited governance, weak moderation, no paywalls or tiering, poor visibility. | Roles, tier points, leaderboards, chat, paywalls, moderation queues, admin extensions, mobile oversight. |
| **Administrators / Support** | Lack of observability, compliance controls, and unified operations. | R2 monitoring, policy hub, notification centre, support panel, analytics, incident response runbooks, explorer telemetry. |
| **Mobile User** | Feature parity gaps, inconsistent navigation. | Dedicated Flutter modules for profiles, communities, explorer, chat, notifications, and payment flows. |

## Feature Pillars & Scope

- Monitoring dashboards for latency, error rates, storage cost, and bandwidth per feature.

### 2. Course PowerPoint Enablement
- PowerPoint ingestion pipeline (R2 upload, conversion service, slide thumbnails, transcript extraction).
- Course builder components for attaching decks to modules, scheduling slide-based live sessions, and reusing decks in communities.
- Web/Flutter PowerPoint player with annotations, presenter notes, dual-mode (self-paced vs instructor-led), and offline caching.
- Analytics capturing slide engagement, drop-off points, and reuse metrics across communities and courses.

### 3. Ebook Upgrade Programme
- Reader redesign with typography controls, audio narration, inline quizzes, highlights, bookmarks, and watermarking (DRM-lite).
- Author console for chapter organisation, bulk import/export, accessibility checks (contrast, alt text), and revenue dashboards.
- Integration with profiles and communities (share excerpts, embed in posts, attach to lessons).
- R2-backed asset pipelines with preview generation, device binding, and expiry policies.

### 4. Follow Graph & Social Signals
- Relationship model covering follow, unfollow, block, mute, and reporting; includes privacy settings and audit logs.
- Recommendation engine using shared courses, mutual communities, search history, tutor ratings, and tier points.
- Notification centre for follows, mentions, feed highlights, leaderboard changes, and tutor availability.
- Feed ranking service that merges course milestones, community posts, ads, and affiliate promotions based on the follow graph.

### 5. Profile Area Redesign (Component Architecture)
- Component catalogue: hero header, role badges, course/ebook shelves, community memberships, affiliate widgets, revenue stats, timelines, actions.
- Support for multiple user types (Student, Instructor) with tailored quick actions, access controls, and dashboards.
- Backend aggregation layer with caching, analytics hooks, and search indexing.
- Full stack delivery: database migrations, seeders, API endpoints, React components, Flutter widgets, styling tokens, localization, accessibility.

### 6. Communities 2.0 (Skool-class)
- Community home redesign with hero, announcements, feed filters, classroom integration, map views, tier badges, streaks, and resources.
- Content lifecycle including posts, polls, comments, replies, maps, events, calendars, classroom sessions, and document libraries.
- Governance (members, admins, moderators, owners), tier points, leaderboards, subscription/paywall tiers, role actions, and audit trails.
- Affiliate marketplace and earnings withdrawal for community owners and members.
- Upgraded chat/inbox with channels, DMs, notifications, Agora live hooks, online tracker, moderation tools.
- Admin panel extensions for community oversight, incident management, compliance, and analytics.
- Flutter parity: feeds, chat, maps, leaderboards, admin tooling, affiliate management, notifications.

### 7. Explorer & Search Engine
- Explorer entry in navigation and header with saved searches, breadcrumbs, and personalised quick filters.
- Meilisearch integration with synonyms, typo tolerance, ranking rules using follow graph, ratings, tier points, tutor availability, recency, and ad signals.
- ETL pipelines for communities, profiles, courses, ebooks, tutors, ads, events; queue-based incremental updates and scheduled reindexing.
- Explorer UI (web + Flutter) with entity tabs, map previews, voice search, offline recents, deep links to detail pages, and analytics instrumentation.

### 8. Cross-Cutting Enablers
- Notification centre with granular preferences, push/web/mobile integration, and fallback email digests.
- Policy hub for privacy, terms, guidelines, spam/bad word detection, moderation, and compliance dashboards.
- Analytics observability: dashboards for storage, feed engagement, community health, search adoption, revenue, and churn.
- Admin & support consoles for approvals, incident response, refunds, and customer success automation.

## Architecture Considerations
- **Service Domains:** Storage (R2), Content (courses, ebooks, powerpoints), Social (follows, feeds), Communities, Search (Meilisearch), Commerce (payments, paywalls), Notifications, Analytics, Mobile API gateway.
- **Data Strategy:** Versioned migrations, seeders, rollback playbooks, fixture datasets for QA, and data governance (PII masking, retention).
- **Integration Contracts:** REST + GraphQL endpoints with OpenAPI, mobile SDK updates, webhook contracts for payments and community events.
- **Scalability & Reliability:** Autoscaling workers, background jobs, caching (Redis/Cloudflare KV), CDN optimisation, blue/green deployments, feature flags per capability.

## Success Metrics
- 99% success rate and <250ms median latency for R2 asset delivery across regions.
- 40% uplift in course/ebook engagement due to PowerPoint and reader upgrades.
- 30% increase in social interactions (follows, comments, chat) within 60 days of launch.
- 25% growth in community retention measured by tier points and leaderboards.
- <2% zero-result explorer searches and <300ms median response time.
- 90% Flutter parity coverage within two sprints post-launch.

## Risk & Mitigation Snapshot
| Risk | Impact | Mitigation |
| --- | --- | --- |
| R2 migration downtime | Content inaccessible | Dual-write adapters, phased migration, rollback scripts, synthetic testing. |
| Meilisearch schema drift | Search accuracy degradation | Automated schema validation, contract tests, versioned indexes. |
| Community paywall compliance | Revenue leakage or legal exposure | Stripe audit, tax/VAT calculators, legal review, sandbox testing. |
| Mobile parity slippage | Feature inconsistency | Dedicated Flutter squad, weekly parity reviews, shared component specs. |
| Moderation overload | Policy breaches | Automated spam/bad word filters, escalation SLAs, admin dashboards, training. |

## Launch & Change Management
1. **Enablement** – Train support, instructor success, and community managers on new profiles, paywalls, and explorer workflows; publish SOPs and video walkthroughs.
2. **Beta Cohorts** – Roll out to internal staff → instructor champions → select learner groups; monitor telemetry, collect qualitative feedback, and iterate.
3. **Marketing & Communications** – Release microsite, power user webinars, community spotlights, social teasers, and in-product tours emphasising R2 speed, communities, and explorer.
4. **Rollout Strategy** – Use feature flags for R2, follow graph, communities, paywalls, and explorer; stagger release by geography and user type.
5. **Post-Launch Operations** – War room for the first 30 days reviewing dashboards, incident queues, NPS, and adoption KPIs; backlog grooming for Version 1.01 improvements.
