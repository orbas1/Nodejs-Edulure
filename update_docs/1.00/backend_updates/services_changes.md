# Service Changes – Version 1.00

- Added `DomainEventDispatcherService` to orchestrate outbox processing with configurable polling, exponential backoff, jitter, stuck-job recovery, and Prometheus instrumentation. The service publishes dispatched events to the webhook bus using correlation-aware metadata so subscriber webhooks receive consistent payloads.
- Updated the worker bootstrap to register the dispatcher alongside existing schedulers. Readiness probes now expose a `domain-event-dispatcher` component that reports degraded state when the pipeline is disabled and surfaces start-up failures to logs.
- Extended `DomainEventModel` so every recorded event can enqueue a dispatch entry within the same transaction while preserving backward compatibility for services that pass custom connections. JSON payloads are normalised to avoid parsing bugs during replay.
- Introduced `FeatureFlagGovernanceService` to synchronise the new manifest catalogue, hydrate tenant overrides, emit audit records, and refresh the runtime cache so feature availability matches documented rollout plans.
- Enhanced `FeatureFlagService` with tenant override awareness, wildcard handling, and richer evaluation payloads (environment, override metadata) enabling operators and tests to reason about applied governance decisions.
- Refactored `PaymentService` to consume the new integration gateways, providing sandbox-aware Stripe/PayPal operations, idempotent webhook handling backed by receipt storage, and resilient refund/capture flows instrumented with shared retry and circuit breaker policies.
- Added `IntegrationProviderService` as the single entry point for provisioning third-party clients, ensuring worker processes and HTTP handlers share Redis-backed circuit breakers, retry defaults, and sandbox routing logic.
- Taught `CommunityReminderJob` to deliver SMS reminders through the Twilio gateway with templated messaging, metadata-driven destinations, and graceful degradation when messaging is not configured, while continuing to emit domain events for auditing.
- Added `AuditEventService` to encapsulate encrypted audit logging with request-context enrichment, metadata redaction, and retention-aware truncation, wiring `ComplianceService` to depend on the new contract for every DSR and consent lifecycle change.
- Enhanced `ComplianceService`, `AuditEventService`, and `DataPartitionService` with attestation roll-ups, audit summaries, and archive discovery helpers that calculate role coverage, detect expiring consents, and expose evidence exports for the operator dashboard.
- Expanded `OperatorDashboardService` to orchestrate the new compliance snapshot, risk heatmaps, framework summaries, and evidence export payloads while guarding downstream dependencies until tenants opt into the console.
- Rebuilt the instructor branch of `DashboardService.getDashboardForUser` to lazily import course domain models, hydrate the new
  `coursesWorkspace` payload (catalogue, cohorts, assignments, authoring, learners), and attach collaborator directories without
  penalising instructors that do not yet have active courses.
- Created `sloRegistry` under the observability module to aggregate HTTP outcomes, maintain burn-rate budgets, compute latency percentiles, and expose helper APIs for HTTP instrumentation, controllers, and contract tests.
- Added `EnvironmentParityService` to compute infrastructure manifest hashes, run dependency probes, and assemble parity reports consumed by the new admin health endpoint. 【F:backend-nodejs/src/services/EnvironmentParityService.js†L1-L217】
- Created `SecurityOperationsService` backed by a repository layer to score risks, record reviews, log audit evidence, orchestrate continuity drills, and schedule assessments with automatic audit and CDC emissions so compliance workflows stay observable and automatable. 【F:backend-nodejs/src/services/SecurityOperationsService.js†L1-L421】【F:backend-nodejs/src/repositories/SecurityOperationsRepository.js†L1-L452】
- Replaced the CloudConvert integration with a native `CloudConvertClient` that wraps fetch, retry, timeout, and circuit breaker controls so asset ingestion can operate without the deprecated SDK. 【F:backend-nodejs/src/integrations/CloudConvertClient.js†L1-L210】
- Added `TelemetryIngestionService` to validate payloads, enforce consent, emit metrics, and persist events into the new telemetry domain, wiring request context metadata and freshness tracking for downstream analytics. 【F:backend-nodejs/src/services/TelemetryIngestionService.js†L1-L173】
- Introduced `TelemetryWarehouseService` to batch pending events, export compressed JSONL manifests to object storage, update freshness checkpoints, and record lineage runs after successful exports. 【F:backend-nodejs/src/services/TelemetryWarehouseService.js†L1-L197】
- Introduced `BusinessIntelligenceService` to aggregate reporting views, compute KPI deltas, surface experiment metadata, and en
rich executive dashboards with telemetry freshness and currency breakdowns. 【F:backend-nodejs/src/services/BusinessIntelligence
Service.js†L1-L265】
