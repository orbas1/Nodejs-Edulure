# Controller Changes

- `AuthController` now enforces a 12+ character password policy with uppercase/lowercase/number/symbol checks, captures request context (IP/User-Agent) for session logging, and returns standardised response envelopes.
- `UserController` and `CommunityController` validate query/body payloads with Joi, wrap responses in the shared envelope helper, and surface descriptive pagination metadata.
- Introduced `ContentController` delivering upload session creation, ingestion confirmation, asset listing/detail, viewer token issuance, analytics reporting, progress tracking, and event logging backed by the new AssetService.
