- Added `AdminFeatureFlagController` with endpoints for manifest synchronisation, tenant snapshot retrieval, and override management so platform operators can govern capability exposure without database access.
- Introduced `ObservabilityController` to expose SLO list/detail endpoints with optional definition metadata and audit logging so operators can inspect burn rate health programmatically.
- Created `EnvironmentParityController` to surface parity reports that combine manifest fingerprints, dependency probes, and drift classifications for release engineers. 【F:backend-nodejs/src/controllers/EnvironmentParityController.js†L1-L13】
- Added `SecurityOperationsController` with admin-authenticated handlers for risk register listings, status updates, audit evidence capture, continuity drill logging, and assessment scheduling so compliance teams can orchestrate governance workflows from the API. 【F:backend-nodejs/src/controllers/SecurityOperationsController.js†L1-L199】
- Added `TelemetryController` with authenticated endpoints for event ingestion, consent registration, freshness inspection, and manual export triggers powering the telemetry pipeline. 【F:backend-nodejs/src/controllers/TelemetryController.js†L1-L115】
- Added `BusinessIntelligenceController` to expose the `/analytics/bi/executive-overview` endpoint with tenant-aware range parsing and `StandardResponse` envelopes. 【F:backend-nodejs/src/controllers/BusinessIntelligenceController.js†L1-L26】
- Added `EnablementController` with admin-authenticated article listing, detail, capability matrix, and reindex endpoints so programme owners and operator tooling can consume the refreshed enablement knowledge base over the API. 【F:backend-nodejs/src/controllers/EnablementController.js†L1-L78】
- Added `GovernanceController` with admin-protected overview, contract lifecycle, vendor assessment, review cycle, and communication endpoints so programme owners can steer governance cadences and stakeholder messaging from the API surface. 【F:backend-nodejs/src/controllers/GovernanceController.js†L1-L164】
- Added `ReleaseManagementController` to surface checklist listings, run scheduling, gate evaluation, readiness assessments, and dashboard payloads for release engineers with audited envelopes. 【F:backend-nodejs/src/controllers/ReleaseManagementController.js†L1-L139】

- Wrapped `AdminMonetizationController` responses in the standard `{ success, message, data, meta }` envelope and enriched pagination metadata so operator tooling consumes consistent contracts across catalog, usage, schedules, and reconciliation APIs.
