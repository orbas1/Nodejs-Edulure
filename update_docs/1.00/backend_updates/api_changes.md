- Introduced `/api/v1/admin/feature-flags` endpoints for operators to sync the manifest, retrieve tenant snapshots, and apply or remove overrides. Responses include evaluation context and audit metadata so governance actions are transparent.
- Extended `/dashboard/me` to return an instructor `coursesWorkspace` object containing catalogue, cohort analytics, assignment
  queues, authoring drafts, and learner risk signals, enabling the new course management experience to render without additional
  round trips.
- Augmented `/dashboard/admin` compliance payloads with audit summaries, attestation analytics, framework snapshots, risk heatmaps, incident response queues, and evidence archive metadata so the operator console can render without follow-up requests.
- Published `/observability/slos` list and detail APIs returning burn-rate analytics, latency percentiles, and definition metadata so operations tooling can query SLO health without bespoke dashboards.
- Added `/environment/health` behind admin auth to return infrastructure manifest fingerprints, dependency probe outcomes, and overall parity status so release engineering can block promotions when drift or degraded dependencies are detected. 【F:backend-nodejs/src/routes/environmentParity.routes.js†L1-L9】【F:backend-nodejs/src/controllers/EnvironmentParityController.js†L1-L13】【F:backend-nodejs/src/docs/openapi.json†L8328-L8373】
- Added `/security/risk-register`, `/security/audit-evidence`, `/security/continuity/exercises`, and `/security/assessments` APIs with admin RBAC, pagination, and OpenAPI coverage so governance teams can manage risk registers, evidence libraries, continuity drills, and assessment schedules programmatically. 【F:backend-nodejs/src/routes/security.routes.js†L1-L17】【F:backend-nodejs/src/controllers/SecurityOperationsController.js†L1-L199】【F:backend-nodejs/src/docs/openapi.json†L6500-L7600】
- Published `/telemetry` endpoints for event ingestion, consent governance, freshness inspection, and manual export triggers so services and operators can drive the new telemetry pipeline without bespoke integrations. 【F:backend-nodejs/src/routes/telemetry.routes.js†L1-L11】【F:backend-nodejs/src/controllers/TelemetryController.js†L1-L115】【F:backend-nodejs/src/routes/routeMetadata.js†L73-L81】
- Documented the telemetry pipeline endpoints (`/telemetry/events`, `/telemetry/consents`, `/telemetry/freshness`, `/telemetry/ex
port`) and the executive BI overview route in the OpenAPI specification, ensuring SDK consumers receive payload contracts for in
gestion, consent, freshness reporting, exports, and analytics. 【F:backend-nodejs/src/docs/openapi.json†L8800-L9560】

- Updated admin monetisation paths in `openapi.json` to describe the standard success envelope, tenant metadata, and pagination payloads so the contract matches the hardened controller responses.
- Added `/enablement/articles`, `/enablement/articles/{slug}`, `/enablement/capability-matrix`, and `/enablement/reindex` endpoints returning curated enablement content, capability matrices, and index refresh summaries with admin RBAC. The OpenAPI spec documents query filters, slug path params, HTML/markdown formats, and response schemas for downstream portals. 【F:backend-nodejs/src/docs/openapi.json†L9050-L9225】【F:backend-nodejs/src/routes/enablement.routes.js†L1-L11】
- Published `/governance` overview, `/governance/contracts`, `/governance/vendor-assessments`, `/governance/review-cycles`, and `/governance/communications` endpoints so programme owners can monitor contract renewals, vendor risk, review cadences, and roadmap communications from authenticated APIs. The OpenAPI spec documents filters, decision payloads, metrics recording, and success envelopes for each route. 【F:backend-nodejs/src/routes/governance.routes.js†L1-L21】【F:backend-nodejs/src/controllers/GovernanceController.js†L1-L164】【F:backend-nodejs/src/docs/openapi.json†L1-L9999】
