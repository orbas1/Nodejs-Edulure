# API Changes

- All endpoints now return `{ success, message, data, meta }` envelopes; validation errors respond with HTTP 422 and descriptive arrays.
- Added `/api/docs` Swagger UI exposing the OpenAPI 3.0 specification used by web/mobile clients.
- `/health` now runs database health checks and returns a structured payload.
- Introduced `/api/content/assets` suite:
  - `POST /assets/upload-session` for presigned Cloudflare R2 uploads with payload validation and size enforcement.
  - `POST /assets/{assetId}/ingest` to confirm uploads, stream files through antivirus scanning, quarantine infected artefacts, queue ingestion jobs, and transition lifecycle states.
  - `GET /assets`, `GET /assets/{assetId}`, and `GET /assets/{assetId}/analytics` for listing, detail, and analytics views.
  - `GET /assets/{assetId}/viewer-token` and `/progress` endpoints for DRM-protected viewer access and ebook telemetry.
- Exposed `/api/content/assets/{assetId}/events` for recording view/download/progress actions from clients.
- Updated `/api/auth/register` and `/api/auth/login` responses to surface verification metadata alongside the user object, tokens, and session envelope, aligning with the new OpenAPI definitions and returning structured error details for lockout thresholds.
- Added `/api/auth/verify-email` for token confirmation and `/api/auth/resend-verification`, `/api/auth/refresh`, `/api/auth/logout`, `/api/auth/logout-all` for throttled verification and session governance flows, all documented with validation, caching semantics, and error responses.
- Expanded the OpenAPI specification with `/api/courses` endpoints covering course CRUD, module/lesson/assignment management, enrollment, and progress tracking; new schemas (`Course`, `CourseModule`, `CourseLesson`, `CourseAssignment`, `CourseProgress*`) document drip metadata, progress states, and assignment grading contracts.
- Added `/api/ebooks` endpoints detailing ebook listing/detail, creation/update/publish, chapter CRUD + reorder, highlight/bookmark APIs, reader settings, and DRM download issuance; new schemas (`Ebook*`) capture manifest metadata, chapter stats, reader preferences, and download limits to keep web/mobile clients aligned with the upgraded backend.
- Documented `/api/tutors` endpoints covering tutor profile CRUD, availability slot publishing, booking creation/cancellation, booking summary analytics, and payout preparation hints; schemas define availability windows, hourly rates, booking states, and tutor engagement metrics.
- Added `/api/live-classrooms` endpoints for classroom scheduling, registration (free/paid), attendee roster management, join context issuance (Agora tokens + CDN ingest URLs), chat session retrieval, and post-session analytics; schemas define seat limits, invite codes, pricing, chat transcripts, and join payloads for frontend/mobile parity.
- Added `/api/payments` endpoints for intent creation, PayPal capture, refund issuance, finance summaries, coupon lookups, and Stripe webhook ingestion with new schemas for payment line items, intent records, refund requests, coupons, and finance summary entries.
- Expanded `/api/communities` engagement surface with `/engagement/progress`, `/engagement/points`, `/engagement/streaks/check-in`, `/engagement/leaderboard`, event listing/creation, RSVP, reminder scheduling, and calendar endpoints documented in OpenAPI so web, mobile, and ops clients can drive streaks, tier progression, and automated reminders.
- Added the community messaging contract: `/api/communities/{communityId}/chat/channels` (listing), `/chat/channels/{channelId}/messages` (timeline + filters), `/chat/channels/{channelId}/messages/:id/reactions`, `/chat/channels/{channelId}/messages/:id/moderate`, `/chat/channels/{channelId}/read`, and `/chat/presence` endpoints with threaded replies, reaction payloads, moderation actions, read receipts, and presence updates reflected in the OpenAPI schemas.
- Introduced `/api/chat/threads`, `/api/chat/threads/{threadId}/messages`, and `/api/chat/threads/{threadId}/read` endpoints powering direct messaging; OpenAPI now documents thread creation (with optional initial message), pagination, DM payloads, and read receipt responses for frontend/mobile clients.
- Added `/api/social` endpoints covering follower/following lists (`/followers`, `/following`, and scoped `/users/{userId}/...` variants), follow/unfollow actions, approval/decline flows, recommendations, mute/block management, and privacy retrieval/update. New schemas capture follow relationships, social user summaries, recommendation payloads, viewer context metadata, and privacy settings, while responses honour the shared envelope and document 202 pending follow semantics.
- Added `/api/explorer/search` and `/api/explorer/saved-searches` endpoints powering federated discovery: requests accept entity selection, filter/sort payloads, and saved search metadata, while responses return normalised hits, facet distributions, geo marker collections, and saved search resources aligned with the expanded OpenAPI schemas.
- Documented `/api/profiles/{userId}/overview` delivering hero metrics, verification badges, achievement shelves, programme/community shelves, quick actions, engagement insights, and timeline events. The OpenAPI specification now details caching semantics, privacy-aware 403/404 responses, and the aggregated schema consumed by dashboards and mobile clients.
- Updated `/api/dashboard/me` schema to include notifications, follower governance, financial, and settings payloads; added follower/recommendation user identifiers; and documented the new `PATCH /api/chat/threads/preferences/notifications` endpoint plus `DirectMessageNotificationPreference*` schemas so learners can manage DM alerts.
- `/api/dashboard/me` now exposes instructor dashboards alongside learner data: the schema documents the `roles` array, `dashboards.instructor` object (metrics, analytics, courses, communities, schedules, bookings, ebooks, ads, pricing, calendar), expanded profile stats/bio fields, and search index entries so frontend/mobile clients can render instructor experiences without bespoke joins.
- Added `/api/verification` endpoints orchestrating KYC flows: learners/instructors request upload URLs (`POST /upload-url`), attach completed uploads with checksum validation (`POST /documents`), submit for review (`POST /submit`), retrieve verification summaries/audit logs (`GET /me`, `/audit`), while admin reviewers access queue overviews (`GET /admin/overview`), review specific cases (`POST /admin/verifications/:id/review`), and stream audit history. Schemas describe required document types, outstanding document arrays, SLA timers, review metadata (risk scores, escalation levels, policy references), and audit entries so clients mirror the compliance workflow and storage integration.
