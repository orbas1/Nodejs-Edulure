- Introduced `/api/v1/admin/feature-flags` endpoints for operators to sync the manifest, retrieve tenant snapshots, and apply or remove overrides. Responses include evaluation context and audit metadata so governance actions are transparent.
- Extended `/dashboard/me` to return an instructor `coursesWorkspace` object containing catalogue, cohort analytics, assignment
  queues, authoring drafts, and learner risk signals, enabling the new course management experience to render without additional
  round trips.
- Augmented `/dashboard/admin` compliance payloads with audit summaries, attestation analytics, framework snapshots, risk heatmaps, incident response queues, and evidence archive metadata so the operator console can render without follow-up requests.
- Published `/observability/slos` list and detail APIs returning burn-rate analytics, latency percentiles, and definition metadata so operations tooling can query SLO health without bespoke dashboards.
- Added `/environment/health` behind admin auth to return infrastructure manifest fingerprints, dependency probe outcomes, and overall parity status so release engineering can block promotions when drift or degraded dependencies are detected. 【F:backend-nodejs/src/routes/environmentParity.routes.js†L1-L9】【F:backend-nodejs/src/controllers/EnvironmentParityController.js†L1-L13】【F:backend-nodejs/src/docs/openapi.json†L8328-L8373】
- Added `/security/risk-register`, `/security/audit-evidence`, `/security/continuity/exercises`, and `/security/assessments` APIs with admin RBAC, pagination, and OpenAPI coverage so governance teams can manage risk registers, evidence libraries, continuity drills, and assessment schedules programmatically. 【F:backend-nodejs/src/routes/security.routes.js†L1-L17】【F:backend-nodejs/src/controllers/SecurityOperationsController.js†L1-L199】【F:backend-nodejs/src/docs/openapi.json†L6500-L7600】
