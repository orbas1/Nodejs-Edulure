# Backend Change Log â€“ Version 1.00

- Hardened the event outbox by pairing `DomainEventModel` with a dedicated dispatch queue, worker integration, and resilience controls (retry, jitter, recovery) to meet SLA expectations for automation flows promised in 1.00.
- Delivered a tenant-aware feature flag governance stack with manifest-driven defaults, bootstrap synchronisation, and admin tooling so operators can evaluate, audit, and override capabilities without engineering interventions.
- Introduced production-grade third-party integration wrappers covering Stripe, PayPal, CloudConvert, and Twilio with sandbox credential routing, Redis-backed circuit breakers, retry/backoff orchestration, webhook idempotency storage, and operational metrics to harden partner workflows.
- Centralised compliance telemetry by introducing an audit event service that encrypts IP evidence, enforces metadata retention budgets, and exposes a single interface for background jobs and controllers to emit SOC2-ready trails.
