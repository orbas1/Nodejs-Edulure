- Extended `admin.routes.js` with `/feature-flags` routes that expose manifest sync, tenant snapshot, and override CRUD endpoints guarded by the admin auth middleware.
- Registered `observability.routes.js` to expose `/observability/slos` list/detail endpoints behind admin auth, publishing burn-rate telemetry and metadata for SRE dashboards.
- Registered `environmentParity.routes.js` under `/environment/health` so admins can retrieve infrastructure parity reports without loading the entire operator app. 【F:backend-nodejs/src/routes/environmentParity.routes.js†L1-L9】
- Registered `security.routes.js` at `/security` to expose risk register, audit evidence, continuity exercise, and assessment endpoints behind admin RBAC for compliance and security operators. 【F:backend-nodejs/src/routes/security.routes.js†L1-L17】
