# Admin Dashboard Updates â€“ Version 1.00

## Executive overview rebuild
- Delivered a tenant-aware executive overview that surfaces platform KPIs, incident posture, release readiness, and fraud/security alerts in a consolidated responsive grid. The page now consumes live capability manifests and incident feeds, replacing the static learner overview fallback administrators previously saw.
- Introduced a persistent offline cache backed by IndexedDB so operations teams retain the last known metrics when travelling or during network interruptions. The UI raises connectivity banners, timestamps cached payloads, and automatically refreshes when connectivity returns.
- Added granular sections for service health, incident queues, release trains, operations readiness, and audit timelines, each drawing from dedicated API endpoints and enriched with accessibility-friendly status badges and semantic tables.
- Implemented cross-tenant switching directly in the dashboard header. The selector hydrates from `/operator/executive/tenants`, scopes subsequent data fetches, and protects against stale selections when tenants are revoked.

## Data orchestration & testing
- Created a reusable `operatorDashboardApi` client that normalises KPIs, incidents, releases, alerts, and dependency payloads from the operator services. Requests are cached with explicit TTLs and tag invalidation so the executive dashboard can refresh without overloading the API.
- Built a `useExecutiveDashboard` hook that coordinates tenant discovery, overview fetching, offline fallbacks, auto-refresh intervals, and visibility-aware polling. The hook exposes stale/offline states to drive the new UI banners and manual refresh CTA.
- Added Vitest coverage for the executive hook to verify happy-path loading and cached fallback behaviour when API calls fail. The suite mocks the persistent cache, ensuring the offline and retry logic remains deterministic as we evolve the dashboard.

## Finance & monetisation centres
- Implemented the Revenue & Finance command centre under `AdminFinanceMonetisation`, surfacing billing ageing analytics, autopay and dispute metrics, open invoice controls, payout approval workflows, ledger reconciliation dashboards, and experiment/pricing governance in a responsive layout designed for finance operators.
- Wired the finance page to a tenant-aware `useFinanceDashboard` hook that shares the offline caching and polling guarantees introduced for the executive overview while layering in optimistic updates for approving payouts, settling invoices, and stopping experiments.
- Added action feedback banners, offline detection, and accessibility-minded tables so finance teams receive immediate confirmation of ledger actions and maintain context across keyboard navigation and reduced-motion environments.

## Finance orchestration & testing
- Extended `operatorDashboardApi` with finance-aware endpoints covering overview fetches, tenant discovery, payout approvals, invoice settlement, and experiment shutdown. Responses are normalised into production-ready data structures that drive the new UI.
- Authored Vitest coverage for the finance dashboard hook to validate tenant bootstrap, cached fallback behaviour, and local state mutation helpers, protecting the finance workflow UX from regressions.

## Support, communications, and settings hub
- Introduced an operator support hub at `AdminSupportHub` that unifies ticket triage, escalation, automation health, communications scheduling, knowledge base governance, and onboarding playbooks behind a tenant-aware UI with offline awareness, accessibility-first components, and actionable metrics.
- Added a `useSupportDashboard` hook and supporting API client methods for support tenants, ticket assignment/escalation, broadcast scheduling, and notification policy updates with optimistic state management, cached fallbacks, and background polling.
- Implemented production-grade ticket, communications, and notification interactions, including inline escalation workflows, broadcast composition, and channel toggles that persist through the new API endpoints while surfacing success/failure feedback to operators.
