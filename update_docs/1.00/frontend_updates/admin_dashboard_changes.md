# Admin Dashboard & Operational Console Updates

- **Runtime gating & escalation copy:** When `admin.operational-console` is disabled the page renders an access banner with the configured escalation channel from `admin.console.escalation-channel`, matching the disable overlays documented in `Admin_panel_drawings.md`, `Design_Plan.md`, and `ui-ux_updates/Web Application Design Update/Settings Dashboard.md`.
- **KPI tiles backed by live aggregates:** `AdminStats.jsx` renders subscription, community, and engagement deltas supplied by `/api/dashboard/me`, formatting net revenue, active subscriptions, community launches, and daily active members exactly as specified in `dashboard_drawings.md` so operators can spot momentum shifts without leaving the console.
- **Approvals queue parity with backend payloads:** The approvals section lists pending memberships, affiliate payouts, and follow approvals with urgency/status pills, amount badges, and review CTAs aligned to `Admin_panel_drawings.md` while reusing the shared `formatNumber` utility for consistent numeric presentation.
- **Revenue and payment health workspace:** The revenue deck displays net revenue, ARR/MRR, capture rate, failed payments, and refunds pending alongside a CSV export button that produces an analytics-ready report. Payment health cards summarise succeeded/processing/requires-action/failed counts, mirroring finance callouts described in `Design_Task_Plan_Upgrade/Web_Application_Design_Update/Web Application Design Update.md`.
- **Operations snapshot:** Support, risk, and platform statistics render backlog volume, follow approvals, payout queues, and total user growth using the card stack from `Admin_panel_drawings.md` to keep incident, finance, and growth stakeholders aligned with the backend telemetry.
- **Policy hub CTA:** A dedicated compliance card exposes policy status, SLA expectations, owner/contact metadata, and a launch button that opens the documented policy workspace. The section derives defaults from runtime configuration and mirrors the policy grids annotated in `Admin_panel_drawings.md` and `Application_Design_Update_Plan/Application Design Update.md`.
- **Compliance review queue:** `AdminComplianceSection` consumes `/api/verification/admin/overview` to list queued verifications with SLA breach badges, outstanding document counts, and reviewer risk scores while enabling approve, reject, and resubmission flows that validate notes, capture policy references, and push updates to the shared audit log. Queue filters mirror compliance wireframes and refresh timers so ops teams can triage identity checks without leaving the console.
- **Activity feeds & analytics shortcut:** Operational alerts surface severity badges and detected/resolved timestamps, while the latest event list links to `DashboardService` domain events. The analytics shortcut routes to `/analytics`, matching the workflow arrows in `dashboard_drawings.md` and the explorer intelligence briefs.
- **Admin utility rails:** Sidebar and header actions expose instructor view switching, admin invitation flows, refresh controls, and responsive navigation chips. All controls reuse the rounded card treatment and typography tokens defined in `ui-ux_updates/Design_Task_Plan_Upgrade/Web_Application_Design_Update/Function Design.md` for implementation consistency.
