# Page Updates – Version 1.50 Task 2

## `/login`
- Replaced static marketing copy with a production form leveraging `AuthContext.login`, inline error states, and MFA placeholders.
- Adds navigation to `/content` after successful authentication to streamline instructor workflows.

## `/register`
- Mirrors hardened authentication styling with actionable onboarding copy and real form state handling via shared `FormField` component improvements.

## `/content`
- New instructor content hub listing Cloudflare R2 assets with status tags, action buttons, analytics sidebar, and embedded viewers.
- Supports uploads with checksum generation, presigned PUT submission, ingestion confirmation, and client-side caching.

## `/checkout`
- Introduced learner checkout experience powered by Stripe Elements and PayPal buttons. Page renders order builder (course, ebook, live class items), coupon application, dynamic tax estimates, and payment method selector wired to `/api/commerce`.
- Implements client-side validation with inline error badges, disabled states during provider handshakes, and redirect handling for PayPal approvals. Surfaces finance support contact and VAT invoice download guidance per runtime config.
- Includes order recap sidebar with responsive layout referencing `website_drawings.md` and `menu_drawings.md`, plus analytics hooks for conversion funnels.

## Layout & Navigation
- `MainLayout` now renders auth-aware navigation items linking to the content library and login/register flows. Navigation visibility for the admin console honours the backend feature flag snapshot to prevent unauthorised access.
- `AuthContext` provider wraps the app in `main.jsx` to propagate session state across routes and components.
- Added Commerce entry points: global navigation exposes “Checkout” when a cart exists, header badge displays cart total, and footer surfaces finance/legal links tied to runtime config.

## `/admin`
- Adds runtime flag gating: when the admin console feature is disabled the page renders an escalation prompt sourced from runtime configuration.
- Existing admin dashboards retain approvals and stats panels once the flag is active, preserving production layouts.
