# Page Updates â€“ Version 1.50 Task 2

## `/login`
- Replaced static marketing copy with a production form leveraging `AuthContext.login`, inline error states, and MFA placeholders.
- Adds navigation to `/content` after successful authentication to streamline instructor workflows.

## `/register`
- Mirrors hardened authentication styling with actionable onboarding copy and real form state handling via shared `FormField` component improvements.

## `/content`
- New instructor content hub listing Cloudflare R2 assets with status tags, action buttons, analytics sidebar, and embedded viewers.
- Supports uploads with checksum generation, presigned PUT submission, ingestion confirmation, and client-side caching.

## `/feed`
- React feed now consumes live `/api/communities` endpoints via `communityApi.js`, replacing mock data with authenticated pagination, aggregated feeds, and community-specific queries.
- `Feed.jsx` orchestrates community switching, feed pagination, and resource loading states with accessible error handling, ensuring aggregated views skip redundant resource calls while member-only hubs render role badges and metadata.
- `CommunityProfile.jsx`, `CommunitySwitcher.jsx`, and `TopBar.jsx` introduce production-ready resource drawers, load-more controls, focus-visible switcher states, and localisation-friendly metadata formatting aligned with design overlays.

## Layout & Navigation
- `MainLayout` now renders auth-aware navigation items linking to the content library and login/register flows. Navigation visibility for the admin console honours the backend feature flag snapshot to prevent unauthorised access.
- `AuthContext` provider wraps the app in `main.jsx` to propagate session state across routes and components.

## `/admin`
- Adds runtime flag gating: when the admin console feature is disabled the page renders an escalation prompt sourced from runtime configuration.
- Existing admin dashboards retain approvals and stats panels once the flag is active, preserving production layouts.
