# User Profile Updates â€“ Version 1.00 Task 5.1

## Overview
- Replaced placeholder profile rendering with a production dashboard that consumes the aggregated payload from `/api/profiles/{id}/overview`.
- Implemented a dedicated API client (`src/api/profileApi.js`) and React Query hook (`src/hooks/useProfileOverview.js`) that cache responses, expose manual refresh helpers, and normalise error states for consistent component consumption.
- Added a component suite (`ProfileHero`, `ProfileBadges`, `ProfileInsights`, `ProfileShelves`, `ProfileQuickActions`, `ProfileTimeline`) delivering responsive layouts, skeleton loaders, and empty-state education aligned to `Profile Look.md`, `Profile Styling.md`, `dashboard_drawings.md`, and `App_screens_drawings.md`.

## Experience Enhancements
- **Hero metrics:** surfaces avatar, verification badges, follower/engagement counts, profile completion, and availability status with gradient treatments that adapt to emo/high-contrast themes.
- **Badge rail:** renders certification, compliance, and streak badges with tooltip copy sourced from design copy decks; gracefully handles overflow via carousel controls.
- **Insights & quick actions:** highlights retention, conversion, and streak KPIs while exposing edit profile, manage offerings, and review statements CTAs gated by runtime config/feature flags.
- **Programme shelves:** displays enrolled communities, active courses/ebooks, and tutor programmes with lazy-loaded thumbnails, progress meters, and CTA buttons.
- **Timeline:** merges engagement, community, commerce, and verification events with iconography mapped to `dashboard_drawings.md` and ensures chronological pagination for future expansion.

## State Management & Error Handling
- Provides deterministic skeleton/loading indicators for each module, offline banners when aggregation requests fail, and retry controls that respect caching cooldowns.
- Emits toasts and inline escalation copy when backend returns 403/404 (privacy restrictions or missing profile) to align with support workflows.
- Refreshes cache on window focus and profile ID changes to keep stats current without overwhelming the backend cache store.

## Implementation Notes
- New components live under `src/components/profile/` with PropTypes, aria labelling, keyboard support, and responsive breakpoints validated against `Profile Styling.md` and `dashboard_drawings.md`.
- Hook integrates with the shared `httpClient`, centralising auth headers and error normalisation.
- Page-level integration (`src/pages/Profile.jsx`) wires analytics IDs, ensures feature flag gating, and routes to settings/commerce surfaces for follow-up actions.
