# Frontend Change Log â€“ Version 1.50 Task 2

- Introduced an authenticated content library route (`/content`) featuring presigned upload flows, analytics sidebars, and embedded PowerPoint/PDF/Ebook viewers backed by the new `/api/content` endpoints.
- Replaced stub login/register screens with real authentication flows consuming the backend, including MFA placeholders, error messaging, and AuthContext session management.
- Rebuilt the `httpClient` abstraction on top of axios with error normalisation, token header support, upload progress hooks, alongside IDB caching (`idb-keyval`) and PropTypes coverage to stabilise API interactions and enforce component contracts.
- Updated build tooling via `npm install` to capture new dependencies (`epubjs`, `idb-keyval`) and ensured production builds succeed under Vite.
- Added a `RuntimeConfigProvider` to hydrate feature flags/runtime configuration via `/api/runtime`, gating admin navigation, surfacing support contacts, and aligning React with backend governance controls.
- Replaced the placeholder community feed with authenticated API integrations: `Feed.jsx`, `CommunityProfile.jsx`, and `CommunitySwitcher.jsx` now consume live community/feed/resource endpoints, expose accessible loading/error states, paginate resource drawers, and render metadata consistent with the updated design overlays.
- Delivered the Explorer discovery experience at `/explorer`: new page shell aligned to the explorer wireframes, entity tabs driven by live totals, adaptive filter rails, saved search management (create/pin/apply/delete), and a map preview powered by `react-simple-maps` consuming backend geo markers. Added `explorerApi.js` client helpers, refreshed navigation links, controlled `SearchBar` behaviour, and ensured production builds validate the new route.
- Validated explorer/ads dashboards under Vite by reconciling the hoisted `react-simple-maps` dependency within the npm workspace, unblocking production builds and preserving instructor ads analytics tooling.
- Shipped the explorer analytics dashboard at `/analytics`: integrated with `MainLayout` navigation, authenticated via `AuthContext`, equipped with range toggles, manual refresh, KPI tiles, charts, ads/experiment summaries, forecasts, query spotlights, and alert feeds wired to `analyticsApi.js` helpers so providers and operations teams can monitor Explorer performance without leaving the web client.
- Rebuilt the learner profile experience at `/profile`: introduced API client `profileApi.js`, caching hook `useProfileOverview`, and component library (`ProfileHero`, `ProfileBadges`, `ProfileShelves`, `ProfileInsights`, `ProfileTimeline`, `ProfileQuickActions`) rendering live hero metrics, verification badges, programme shelves, insights, quick actions, and activity timeline data fetched from `/api/profiles/{id}/overview` with loading/error/empty states aligned to the new design overlays.
- Launched the instructor monetisation hub at `/dashboard/instructor/pricing`: navigation now includes a monetisation entry, `InstructorPricing.jsx` renders course offer funnels, subscription tier health, live session pricing, and revenue mix analytics by consuming `dashboard.pricing`, and linted data normalisation plus CTA rails align to `dashboard_drawings.md`, `menu_drawings.md`, and `Application_Design_Update_Plan/Application Design Update.md`.
- Delivered the admin control centre at `/admin`: the `DashboardContext` feeds the admin aggregate from `/api/dashboard/me`, `AdminStats.jsx` renders KPI deltas, and the refreshed `Admin.jsx` honours runtime feature flags, renders approvals/revenue/support/policy sections, surfaces CSV export tooling, admin invite workflows, analytics shortcuts, and compliance-focused policy hub CTAs aligned to `Admin_panel_drawings.md`, `dashboard_drawings.md`, and runtime configuration guidance.
- Added production identity verification surfaces: `verificationApi.js` wraps `/api/verification` uploads, submissions, and admin review actions; `VerificationStatusCard` renders outstanding document requirements, upload progress, checksum validation prompts, and submission gates inside learner/instructor dashboards; and `/admin` now includes `AdminComplianceSection` with SLA badges, risk scores, queue filters, and inline review controls so compliance teams can adjudicate KYC cases without leaving the console.
