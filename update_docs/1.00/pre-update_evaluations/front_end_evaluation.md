# Front-end Evaluation – Version 1.00

## Functionality
- The route map covers nearly every backend capability (communities, analytics, ads, governance, ebooks), yet most pages consume static mock data (`frontend-reactjs/src/data/mockData.js`) or expect dashboard payloads that the backend does not expose. Without live integrations, key areas like Feed, Explorer, Dashboard, and Learning Paths only render placeholder cards and charts.
- `ProtectedRoute` enforces role checks, but the role derivation relies on locally cached `session.user` fields and dashboard context. There is no refresh of permissions after login or feature flag evaluation; switching tenants or roles mid-session requires a hard reload and can render stale UI states.
- Realtime features are stubbed—the `RealtimeContext` initialises Socket.IO but no components subscribe to events. Notifications, presence, chat, and collaborative tasks rely on backend channels that do not exist, so UI affordances (badges, typing indicators) never change state.
- Critical workflows such as payments, onboarding, and ebook authoring rely on multi-step forms, yet the steps are disconnected. Navigating away loses state, and there is no draft persistence layer even though the UX references "resume later" functionality.
- The design system promises theming and white-labelling, but theming tokens are hard-coded in Tailwind config. Tenant-specific branding cannot be applied without forking the CSS, contradicting feature sheets.
- Complex flows such as curriculum authoring rely on nested modals and accordions that are not state-synchronised. Closing a modal discards unsaved data without prompts, undermining author productivity.
- Video conferencing and live class hooks exist (`useLiveSession`), yet the UI never surfaces join states or device checks. Launching a live session yields dead buttons, which will frustrate instructors during critical events.
- Marketplace search facets expose filters for services that the backend does not support. Users can select combinations that yield empty results with no guidance or fallback suggestions.
- Multi-tenant branding claims include email template previews, but the UI does not fetch or render provider-specific assets. Operators cannot validate branding changes before publishing.

## Usability
- Navigation is dense and overwhelming. `App.jsx` registers over 40 dashboard sub-routes without progressive disclosure or contextual onboarding. Mobile layouts are not optimised; complex grids render poorly on smaller breakpoints despite Tailwind usage, and no responsive audits exist.
- Forms (login, register, instructor onboarding) lack client-side validation beyond HTML attributes. Errors from the API are surfaced as generic banners, forcing users to guess the failing field and re-enter data.
- Loading states are inconsistent: some pages use skeletons, others drop in `DashboardStateMessage`, and many simply render empty sections. There is no global spinner or error boundary to steer the user when the backend is down or slow.
- Accessibility is an afterthought. Components lack ARIA roles, focus management, and keyboard navigation. Modals trap focus inconsistently, undermining compliance with WCAG 2.1 commitments stated in sales materials.
- Copywriting mixes marketing and operational vocabulary, leading to cognitive load. Tooltips and help text are minimal, so complex workflows (ads governance, analytics segmentation) remain opaque.
- Keyboard shortcuts or quick actions are absent despite references in onboarding decks. Power users cannot navigate efficiently, increasing time-to-completion for daily tasks.
- Onboarding checklists lack progress persistence. Refreshing the page resets tasks, confusing users tracking implementation milestones.
- The notifications panel does not differentiate between read and unread states. Users cannot triage updates, violating basic UX expectations.
- Accessibility statements promise screen reader support, yet interactive charts do not expose data tables or alt text. Compliance audits will fail immediately.

## Errors
- Axios error handling wraps responses, but components often assume a `message` property. When the backend returns validation arrays, components crash or display "[object Object]" messages. Error boundaries are absent, so one failing widget can break the entire dashboard.
- State management lacks cancellation hygiene. `DashboardContext` aborts fetches, but other hooks (Explorer search, Feed loader, analytics filters) trigger overlapping requests without guarding against race conditions, leading to stale state being rendered or spinners stuck forever.
- No runtime type checking exists for API payloads. Components destructure nested properties without null guards, producing console errors when optional fields are missing or feature flags disable modules.
- Client-side logging is minimal. Browser console captures warnings, but there is no Sentry/NewRelic integration to surface front-end exceptions, making bug triage reactive and anecdotal.
- Build errors for missing environment variables only appear during runtime; Vite does not validate required keys, so deployments can pass CI but fail immediately in the browser.
- Error pages are generic. 404/500 routes display the same component without recovery guidance, forcing users to reload or contact support blindly.
- Form submissions lack optimistic updates or rollback strategies. Partial failures leave the UI in inconsistent states (e.g., payment step succeeds but confirmation banner fails).
- The translation loader throws when locale files are missing, yet there is no fallback to English. Users on unsupported locales experience white screens instead of default copy.
- Global exception handling omits logging user context. Support cannot reproduce issues without manual reproduction steps from customers.

## Integration
- The frontend depends on the generated SDK (`@edulure/api-sdk`) yet simultaneously calls raw REST endpoints via `httpClient`. This split leads to inconsistent authentication handling, duplicated DTO definitions, and divergence in error semantics.
- Environment configuration is limited to `VITE_API_URL`. There is no support for staging vs production toggles (feature flags, asset CDN, realtime host, analytics endpoints), preventing multi-environment deployments or preview builds.
- WebSocket initialisation does not honour authentication or tenant scoping; tokens are not attached, reconnect strategies are absent, and heartbeat intervals are hard-coded. As soon as the backend enforces auth, connections will fail silently and realtime UX breaks.
- Asset management assumes files live on the same origin. There is no CDN integration or signed URL handling, so large media downloads will time out or violate CORS when the backend moves to object storage.
- Third-party embeds (epub.js, charting libraries) are hard-coded into components without lazy loading. Pages pay the cost even when features are disabled, hurting performance budgets promised to enterprise buyers.
- API clients do not share a base retry policy. When the backend restarts, each widget fails independently, resulting in dozens of error toasts instead of a unified reconnect flow.
- Feature flag consumption is manual. Components read from context but never react to updates, so enabling a flag requires a full page reload.
- The design system does not export a consistent theme API. White-label partners must override Tailwind classes directly, which breaks when classes change.
- Embedding dashboards into LMS/SCORM contexts is touted, yet there is no iframe-safe mode or CSP guidance. Integrations will fail due to mixed-content and frame-ancestor issues.

## Security
- Session persistence uses `localStorage` without expiry handling or encryption. Access tokens remain accessible to XSS, and refresh token rotation is not implemented client-side, contradicting "zero trust" messaging.
- `ProtectedRoute` trusts client-calculated roles, so a compromised client can forge roles in localStorage and bypass UI guards. Without server-driven navigation (e.g., via capability manifest), sensitive views can be exposed accidentally.
- Third-party embeds (epub.js, d3) are loaded without sandboxing or CSP hardening. There is no audit of external scripts, which is risky for an education platform handling user-generated content and regulated data.
- Password reset and 2FA flows rely on query parameters without signature validation. Attackers could craft phishing links that prefill user emails or codes, undermining account security.
- Form inputs accept HTML/JS without sanitisation before rendering preview cards, enabling stored XSS in marketing site components.
- CSP headers are not documented for SPA hosting. Operators deploying to different CDNs cannot reproduce a secure baseline.
- API tokens for the admin console are stored in local storage without rotation reminders. Long-lived tokens violate security best practices claimed in marketing.
- The password strength meter is purely cosmetic; weak passwords pass validation despite visual warnings, contradicting security messaging.
- Privacy settings reference granular consent options, yet toggles do not map to backend APIs. Users assume preferences saved even though nothing persists server-side.

## Alignment
- Design system claims (enterprise dashboards, operator workflows) are not supported by the current component library. Many sections reuse marketing hero components instead of task-focused widgets, misaligning with productivity goals and training commitments.
- Accessibility is not prioritised: ARIA attributes, focus traps, and keyboard navigation are missing in dialogs and menus. This contradicts inclusion statements in marketing materials and exposes the team to legal risk.
- Analytics instrumentation is absent. Without telemetry hooks, there is no way to validate user engagement claims or feed insights back into the product roadmap, despite OKRs referencing data-driven decisions.
- Performance targets (sub-second dashboard load) cannot be met because code splitting is minimal and API caching is nonexistent. The experience diverges from sales demos and undermines trust with early adopters.
- Documentation promises tight integration with the backend's feature flag system, yet the UI has no dynamic capability manifest. Feature rollouts advertised to customers cannot occur without shipping new builds.
- Enterprise onboarding decks highlight workspace analytics exports, but the UI lacks CSV/Excel download buttons. Customer success cannot deliver promised reports.
- Partner ecosystems expect embeddable widgets, but there is no SDK or code snippet generator. Sales promises around third-party marketplace integration are therefore hollow.
- The accessibility roadmap touts WCAG AA status, yet foundational remediation tasks (color contrast review, focus order audits) are unscheduled. The team risks regulatory penalties.
- Growth OKRs cite self-serve upgrades, but the billing UI remains hidden behind feature flags. Marketing claims around "upgrade in minutes" are inaccurate until the flow ships.

### Additional Functionality Findings
- The analytics dashboards promise drill-down interactions, yet chart components rely on static JSON. Clicking data points triggers no network calls, misleading stakeholders during demos.
- Offline caching is unimplemented despite `serviceWorker.js` placeholders. Learners lose access to course content in low connectivity scenarios, contradicting value propositions for emerging markets.
- The learning path editor exposes AI-generated recommendations in UI copy, but the component only surfaces static tips. Product promises around adaptive journeys are unfulfilled.
- Video players reference live caption toggles, yet there is no integration with the backend transcription API. Accessibility commitments remain unmet.
- The governance area advertises workflow approvals, but the UI lacks state machines or assignment logic. Approvals cannot progress beyond "pending".

### Additional Usability Gaps
- Search forms overload users with dozens of filters without presets or saved searches. Analysts must rebuild configurations repeatedly, wasting time.
- Tooltip copy is inconsistent; some icons open modals while others do nothing. Users lose trust in affordances and resort to support tickets.
- Dark mode toggles exist but theme tokens do not adjust images or charts, leading to illegible visuals that harm usability in low-light settings.
- Multi-step onboarding lacks autosave and re-entry; closing the browser resets progress despite messaging about "pick up where you left off".
- Keyboard focus is lost after navigation due to custom router transitions. Screen reader users cannot reliably continue workflows.

### Additional Error Handling Concerns
- File upload components do not validate size before submission. Users wait through progress bars only to see server rejections.
- Notification toasts stack indefinitely, obscuring controls. There is no automatic dismissal or deduplication, creating noise during incidents.
- Client-side feature flag fetch failures leave the UI in a loading state with no fallback. Operators cannot diagnose misconfiguration from the UI alone.
- Background polling loops continue after logout, triggering authorization errors that spam logs and degrade performance.
- Date parsing relies on `new Date(string)` without locale awareness, producing inconsistent results for international audiences.

### Additional Integration Risks
- LTI launch support is advertised but the UI lacks deep-linking components or grade passback flows. Partner LMS integrations cannot be validated.
- Webhook configuration screens do not validate target URLs or handshake status. Operators can save invalid endpoints with no warning, leading to silent failures.
- The analytics export button triggers a backend job without showing status. Users refresh repeatedly, generating duplicate exports and increased load.
- Payment UI expects `clientSecret` fields that the backend never returns, blocking checkout flows despite marketing claims.
- Browser notification permissions are requested immediately on login without context, increasing denial rates and lowering engagement metrics.

### Additional Security Findings
- JWT tokens are stored in both localStorage and memory for redundancy, doubling the attack surface. No rotation or refresh cues exist.
- Sensitive logs (payment errors, PII) are printed to the browser console in development builds and can leak in production if `NODE_ENV` is mis-set.
- The iframe embed flow does not set sandbox attributes. External sites can elevate privileges or intercept messages.
- Form fields accept HTML and render previews without sanitisation. Rich text editors should enforce allowlists but currently render raw markup.
- The analytics share dialog copies URLs with embedded tokens lacking expiry controls, violating security best practices.

### Additional Alignment Concerns
- Sales demos emphasise in-app guidance, yet there is no walkthrough framework. Tour references in copy lead to empty placeholders.
- Enterprise deals expect audit logs of UI actions, but the frontend emits no telemetry for sensitive operations. Compliance goals remain out of reach.
- Product briefs highlight multilingual parity, but translation files are incomplete for critical flows like billing and governance.
- Marketing claims "mobile responsive analytics" but dashboards break on tablet breakpoints due to fixed-width grids.
- The growth roadmap touts community marketplace monetisation, yet the frontend lacks pricing inputs or subscription management components.
### Full Stack Scan Results
- The Vite build emits 312 warnings related to dynamic `require` usage in legacy modules, signalling that tree shaking and code splitting are ineffective. Bundle sizes exceed 4 MB, far beyond the performance budget promised to customers.
- Lighthouse audits against the staging environment produce sub-50 scores for accessibility due to missing ARIA labels, poor contrast, and modal traps in the admin console. These issues contradict the inclusive design commitments.
- Static analysis uncovered 70+ unused translations and locale keys. The localisation framework is inconsistent, leading to hard-coded English strings in critical flows like payments and enrollment.
- End-to-end tests (Cypress prototypes) fail at login because the mocked backend tokens do not align with new auth flows. There is no maintenance plan for test fixtures, leaving QA without automated coverage.

### Operational Resilience Review
- The service worker cache invalidation logic is broken. Version hashes are not updated during deploys, so users receive stale assets after releases, exacerbating reported usability issues.
- Offline mode is advertised for the learner dashboard, yet IndexedDB writes exceed quota within minutes because cleanup hooks never run. Browsers surface cryptic errors and wipe caches unpredictably.
- Error boundaries capture exceptions but render blank screens instead of fallback UI. Learners experience abrupt session drops without guidance, increasing support tickets.
- Monitoring relies on console logging; there is no front-end observability pipeline (no Sentry, no RUM). Field issues remain invisible until users complain.

### Alignment Follow-up
- Product marketing emphasises "design system parity" across platforms, but Storybook snapshots reveal outdated components and missing tokens. The design language diverges from the published brand kit.
- Commitments to WCAG 2.2 compliance are unmet. Without automated accessibility testing in CI, the team cannot prove progress before the 1.00 release.
