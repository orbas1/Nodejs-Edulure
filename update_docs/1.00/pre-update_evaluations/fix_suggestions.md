# Pre-Update Fix Suggestions – Version 1.00

1. **Stabilise core backend services and integrations**
   1.1. Audit every REST and GraphQL route against acceptance criteria, replace stubbed responses with implemented business logic, and pair them with integration, contract, and load tests that run in CI.
   1.2. Wire BullMQ queues, schedulers, cron jobs, and realtime namespaces so payouts, moderation, analytics, recommendations, digest emails, curriculum sync, and retention workflows execute end-to-end with monitored success/failure paths.
   1.3. Ship feature-flag governance that seeds defaults during bootstrap, exposes operator tooling, enforces tenant scoping, validates configuration in automated tests, and documents rollout/rollback procedures.
   1.4. Introduce provider abstractions for Stripe, PayPal, AWS S3, CloudConvert, ClamAV, MeiliSearch, Twilio, LMS connectors, and webhook flows with sandbox credentials, retries, circuit breakers, idempotency keys, and health checks plus dead-letter queues.
   1.5. Harden realtime, webhook, and GraphQL contracts with authenticated channels, versioned event schemas, and shared client libraries consumed by web, mobile, and partner integrations.
   1.6. Stand up on-call dashboards and alerting for backend service health, queue depth, and integration latency so incidents surface before customers report them.

2. **Reinforce data governance, retention, and compliance**
   2.1. Rebuild migrations and seeds in a clean environment, remove brittle `hasTable` guards, add schema diff checks, and gate CI on referential integrity plus deterministic seed fixtures.
   2.2. Deliver scheduled jobs for partition rotation, archival exports, timezone normalisation, materialised reporting views, and ETL pipelines, ensuring services write domain events for auditability.
   2.3. Encrypt sensitive columns, implement least-privilege database roles, document backup/restore drills, and plan region-aware residency with tested failover and replication encryption.
   2.4. Provide a data dictionary, lineage tracking, masking/subset tooling, CDC/outbox connectors, and automated data subject request workflows tied to audit trails.
   2.5. Establish retention policies with automated enforcement, evidence logs for compliance attestations, and recurring governance reviews with legal and security stakeholders.

3. **Unify dependency hygiene and supply-chain security**
   3.1. Standardise on npm workspaces with corepack, containerised dev environments, deterministic lockfiles, and documented binary prerequisites so installations are reproducible across teams and CI.
   3.2. Enable Renovate/Dependabot, npm audit/Trivy scans, SBOM and licence generation in CI, and remediate high-severity advisories (axios, adm-zip, jsonwebtoken, lodash, react-dev-utils, Firebase, base images) with regression coverage.
   3.3. Promote the TypeScript SDK and other shared packages to published workspaces, automate OpenAPI/GraphQL regeneration, and document version matrices for Flutter, Firebase, Terraform, and native dependencies.
   3.4. Harden the supply chain with scoped npm tokens, provenance/signature verification, dependency health dashboards, and an explicit deprecation/rotation policy for libraries and binaries.
   3.5. Package system binaries (ClamAV, FFmpeg, MJML, Chromium, Java) inside Docker images or installer scripts with pinned versions, licence reviews, and CI verification.
   3.6. Introduce policy-as-code checks (Open Policy Agent/conftest) to prevent unreviewed dependency or infrastructure changes from merging without compliance sign-off.

4. **Make the web operator experience production-ready**
   4.1. Replace mock data with SDK-powered data fetching, centralise API clients, and implement caching plus optimistic updates so multi-step workflows persist state across navigation.
   4.2. Add comprehensive form validation, global loading/error boundaries, coherent retry/backoff behaviour, and contextual messaging that guides users during slowdowns or partial failures.
   4.3. Implement authenticated realtime subscriptions, event batching, and reconnect logic for notifications, chat, analytics, and compliance dashboards with graceful fallbacks.
   4.4. Execute an accessibility and localisation programme covering WCAG focus management, ARIA metadata, responsive layouts, translation coverage, right-to-left support, and design token exports for theming.
   4.5. Harden web security by moving tokens to secure storage patterns (HTTP-only cookies or platform-secure vaults), sanitising HTML, defining CSP/sandbox policies, adding Content Security Policy reports, and instrumenting Sentry/RUM for observability.
   4.6. Surface support tooling—impersonation, tenant management, audit logs—behind granular RBAC so customer success can resolve issues without engineering interventions.

5. **Define and execute the provider experience strategy**
   5.1. Publish an explicit end-of-life statement, migration guides, updated playbooks, and support scripts that direct providers to supported scheduling, compliance, payout, and incident workflows.
   5.2. Scope and resource either a responsive web replacement or a new mobile client with committed roadmap milestones, QA plans, offline workflows, and accessibility/localisation coverage.
   5.3. Revoke dormant credentials, rotate secrets, retire push topics, update IAM policies, and clean analytics dashboards to remove noise from defunct provider flows.
   5.4. Restore partner integrations (SSO, LMS, compliance, CRM) through the supported channels, add monitoring to detect stranded provider attempts, and communicate status to stakeholders.
   5.5. Update OKRs, contractual commitments, collateral, and pricing forecasts to reflect the interim provider experience and prevent misaligned expectations.

6. **Harden the learner mobile application**
   6.1. Connect feature flag/bootstrap flows to live backend manifests and implement push notifications, background isolates, downloads, chat, QR attendance, calendar sync, adaptive recommendations, and monetisation with integration and widget tests.
   6.2. Improve UX resilience with launch indicators, deep-link routing, adaptive layouts, localisation coverage, accessibility audits (TalkBack/VoiceOver), theming tokens, and deterministic fixture packs for QA.
   6.3. Add Crashlytics/Sentry instrumentation, analytics funnels, offline retry queues, and contextual error handling that guides users through degraded states instead of crashing.
   6.4. Upgrade security posture by enforcing token refresh/device binding, strengthening secure storage fallbacks, adding SSL pinning and jailbreak/root detection, and synchronising privacy consent with backend records.
   6.5. Establish a mobile CI/CD pipeline (fastlane, automated screenshots, store assets, release checklists) with automated testing, staged rollouts, and rollback automation to keep builds releasable.

7. **Establish cross-platform contracts, observability, and operations**
   7.1. Implement consumer contract tests, schema diff gates, and automated regeneration for SDKs, documentation, and configuration manifests before merging backend changes.
   7.2. Introduce queue management with dead-letter queues, retry policies, idempotency guarantees, and monitoring for background jobs, webhooks, and analytics pipelines, plus infrastructure validation during bootstrap.
   7.3. Stand up central observability (structured logs, metrics, traces) with SLIs/SLOs, alert routing, on-call runbooks, chaos drills, and PagerDuty/Sentry integration covering backend, web, mobile, and data systems.
   7.4. Automate backups, disaster recovery drills, retention enforcement, and environment parity via containerised bootstrap scripts and infrastructure-as-code checks.
   7.5. Add performance, load, accessibility, localisation, and contract regression suites (k6, Lighthouse, axe, Detox/Playwright) to catch degradations before release.

8. **Close security, privacy, and compliance gaps**
   8.1. Centralise secret management, rotate keys, encrypt sensitive data at rest and in transit, adopt KMS-backed key rotation with audit logs, and remove secrets from code repositories.
