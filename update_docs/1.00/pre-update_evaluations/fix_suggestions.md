# Fix Suggestions (v1.50 Pre-Update)

1. **Backend Hardening and Feature Delivery**
   1.1 Ship REST endpoints for feeds, search, notifications, moderation, and admin workflows so web and mobile clients can execute the advertised experiences end-to-end.
   1.2 Introduce a service layer with transaction orchestration that automatically enrols community owners, triggers notifications, and coordinates cross-aggregate updates.
   1.3 Standardise API contracts (shared envelope, DTOs, OpenAPI spec) and extend Joi validation to all inputs, including pagination and path parameters.
   1.4 Enforce security baselines: validate critical environment variables on boot, restrict CORS origins, add rate limiting, strengthen password policies, and mask internal errors in production responses.

2. **Dependency Governance and Tooling Enablement**
   2.1 Remove unused packages (e.g., axios if not required) or wire them into a shared API client; add essential dependencies for queues, background jobs, and mobile networking/state management.
   2.2 Establish workspace tooling (npm workspaces/PNPM, Melos for Flutter) with consistent Node/Flutter version pinning and scripts for linting, formatting, and testing.
   2.3 Configure automated security and upgrade monitoring (Dependabot/Renovate, npm audit in CI, secrets scanning) to keep packages patched.
   2.4 Create shared configuration patterns for environment variables across apps, leveraging dotenv-safe or platform-specific equivalents.

3. **Database Resilience and Compliance**
   3.1 Design and implement schema extensions for feeds, content metadata, payments, analytics, and moderation queues aligned with roadmap commitments.
   3.2 Adopt a formal migrations framework (e.g., Knex migrations) with versioned change scripts, rollback plans, and seeded fixtures managed per environment.
   3.3 Replace hard-coded credentials with environment-scoped users, enforce least-privilege grants, and introduce encryption or hashing for sensitive fields.
   3.4 Implement observability (health checks, slow-query logs, metrics dashboards) and compliance controls (soft deletes, consent tracking, data retention policies).

4. **Front-End Production Readiness**
   4.1 Build an API data layer (React Query/SWR + axios/fetch wrappers) with error handling, loading states, and consistent response parsing.
   4.2 Replace mock data with live integrations for auth, community membership, and feed actions; add form validation, submission handling, and user feedback.
   4.3 Address accessibility and UX gaps by adding labels, focus management, responsive layouts, and skeleton/loading indicators.
   4.4 Introduce environment-based configuration, feature flags, and defensive coding (null guards, suspense boundaries) to handle real-world data variability.

5. **Mobile App Enablement and Security**
   5.1 Integrate HTTP and state management libraries (dio + Riverpod/Bloc) with repositories that consume the backend API and cache results for offline use.
   5.2 Implement authentication, community membership, and feed consumption flows with proper form validation, loading/error states, and navigation patterns (e.g., bottom navigation).
   5.3 Add secure storage for tokens, configure TLS settings, and plan for biometric/PIN gating of sensitive screens.
   5.4 Expand usability support: responsive layouts, keyboard dismissal, retry/fallback UI for network errors, and analytics/push notification hooks aligned with the roadmap.
