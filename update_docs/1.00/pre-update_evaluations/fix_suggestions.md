# Pre-Update Fix Suggestions – Version 1.00

1. **Stabilise backend services and integrations**
   1.1. Inventory every REST/GraphQL route, map to acceptance criteria, and replace stub controllers/resolvers with tested business logic; wire schedulers, BullMQ workers, and realtime namespaces so payments, moderation, analytics, and recommendations run end-to-end.
   1.2. Build feature-flag governance: seed defaults during bootstrap, expose admin tooling for non-engineers, and document rollout recipes so environments stop launching with core APIs disabled.
   1.3. Introduce provider abstractions—sandbox credentials, mocks, and circuit breakers—for Stripe, PayPal, S3, MeiliSearch, CloudConvert, and ClamAV; update health checks to validate downstream connectivity and add dead-letter queues plus PagerDuty/Sentry alerting.
   1.4. Enforce multi-tenant safety by mandating tenancy helpers, adding automated tests for tenant isolation, instrumenting audit logs, and delivering OpenTelemetry traces for critical workflows.

2. **Repair database governance and compliance posture**
   2.1. Re-run migrations in clean environments, fix idempotent guards, complete foreign keys/indexes, and add automated integrity checks (CI schema diff, referential audits) to catch drift.
   2.2. Implement seeds and scheduled jobs that populate reporting tables, rotate partitions, enforce retention policies, and drive domain events so analytics and compliance narratives become real.
   2.3. Encrypt sensitive columns, define least-privilege roles, document backup/restore drills, and codify data residency/geo-sharding plans; publish a data dictionary/ERD and masking toolkit for staging.
   2.4. Provide blue/green or versioned view strategy plus CDC connectors to keep SDKs, warehouse, and downstream integrations aligned during schema evolution.

3. **Modernise dependency management and supply-chain safeguards**
   3.1. Standardise on a single package manager (npm with corepack), convert `sdk-typescript` into a workspace/published package, document binary prerequisites, and update scripts to run from reproducible containers.
   3.2. Enable Renovate/Dependabot, CI npm audit/trivy scans, SBOM generation, and licence checks; remediate high-severity advisories (`axios`, `adm-zip`, `jsonwebtoken`) with secure configurations and regression tests.
   3.3. Align generated SDKs and client contracts with automated codegen triggers tied to backend schema changes; publish Firebase/gradle compatibility matrices and enforce lockfile policies across web and mobile projects.
   3.4. Add supply-chain hardening: scoped npm tokens, provenance/sigstore verification, dependency health dashboards, and documentation covering version lifecycles plus deprecation policy.

4. **Rebuild the web dashboard into a production-ready operator tool**
   4.1. Replace mock data with live API integrations, unify data fetching via the generated SDK, and implement persistent multi-step flows (payments, onboarding, authoring) with draft autosave and recovery.
   4.2. Deliver realtime UX by wiring Socket.IO authentication, subscription hooks, and notification/state sync; add global loading/error boundaries and consistent retry/backoff behaviour.
   4.3. Execute an accessibility and usability overhaul: implement WCAG-compliant navigation/focus management, responsive layouts, validation feedback, localisation coverage, and documented theming tokens for white-labelling.
   4.4. Harden front-end security by moving tokens to HTTP-only cookies or secure storage, sanitising previews, defining CSP headers, sandboxing embeds, and instrumenting Sentry/RUM for observability.

5. **Provide a clear provider experience strategy**
   5.1. Publish an official deprecation notice with migration guides, knowledge-base updates, and alternative workflows for scheduling, compliance capture, payouts, and incident response.
   5.2. Either fund a replacement (responsive dashboard or new mobile client) with scope, timeline, and feature parity, or remove unsupported promises from contracts, marketing, and backend roadmaps.
   5.3. Decommission unused infrastructure—revoke mobile credentials, disable push topics, clean IAM roles—and adjust analytics/alerting to stop surfacing noise from defunct services.
   5.4. Rework partner integrations (SSO, LMS, compliance systems) to operate through supported channels and add monitoring to detect stranded provider attempts during the transition.

6. **Harden the learner mobile app for release**
   6.1. Connect feature-flag/bootstrap flows to live backend manifests, implement push notifications, background isolates, downloads, chat, calendar sync, and monetisation SDKs with integration tests.
   6.2. Improve UX resilience—add launch/loading indicators, deep link routing, navigation guards, adaptive layouts, localisation coverage, and accessible components with TalkBack/VoiceOver validation.
   6.3. Instrument the app with Crashlytics/Sentry, widget tests, and analytics funnels; add network/offline error handling with retries, queued operations, and user guidance.
   6.4. Upgrade security: enforce token refresh/device binding, secure storage fallbacks, SSL pinning, jailbreak/root detection, consent sync, and background key rotation tooling.

7. **Establish cross-cutting operations, monitoring, and alignment**
   7.1. Stand up central observability (logs, metrics, traces) with SLIs/SLOs, alert routing, and incident runbooks spanning backend, web, mobile, and data pipelines.
   7.2. Implement automated contract testing between backend, SDK, web, and mobile; gate releases on compatibility, accessibility, and performance regression suites plus Lighthouse audits.
   7.3. Launch compliance and governance initiatives: SBOM publication, privacy/DSR automation, audit log reviews, and quarterly dependency/vendor assessments aligned with SOC2/ISO requirements.
   7.4. Synchronise roadmap and marketing collateral with delivery reality—publish a parity matrix, set realistic OKRs, and create stakeholder communication plans before promising future capabilities.
