# User App (Flutter) Evaluation (v1.50 Pre-Update)

## Functionality
- Navigation provides entry points for home, login, register, feed, and profile screens, but each screen is populated with hard-coded data. There are no services for authentication, fetching communities, or persisting user actions.
- Forms on login/register screens use bare `TextField` widgets without controllers or submission logic. Buttons simply call empty callbacks, so account creation and login flows are non-functional.
- The feed screen renders a generated list of placeholder posts and chips. There is no stateful interaction (liking, commenting, switching communities) and no real-time updates.

## Usability
- The app adopts Material 3 theming and Google Fonts, providing a consistent aesthetic. However, layout responsiveness is limited; large content cards are not optimised for smaller devices, leading to potential overflow on phones with smaller viewports.
- Input fields lack labels rendered above the fields (relying on floating labels), no validation messages, and no keyboard management (e.g., dismissing keyboard on submit), which hampers mobile usability.
- Navigation stack is flat; there is no bottom navigation or drawer to quickly move between key areas. Deep links (e.g., from push notifications) are not handled.

## Errors
- Without HTTP integration, there is no error handling for network failures or authentication errors. Future integrations must add try/catch blocks and UI states for loading, success, and failure.
- Buttons like "Launch workspace" trigger empty callbacks; developers may forget to implement them, leading to silent failures. There are no unit/widget tests to catch such regressions.
- Assets (images via `NetworkImage`) assume connectivity; there is no fallback or cached placeholder, so offline users will see blank avatars or potential exceptions.

## Integration
- No API client (e.g., `http`, `dio`) or state management solution (Provider, Riverpod, Bloc) is set up. Integrating with the backend will require foundational architecture decisions that might break existing widget structures.
- Authentication state is not persisted. There is no `SharedPreferences`/secure storage usage, making it impossible to keep users logged in across launches once auth is implemented.
- The app does not integrate with analytics, push notifications, or deep link frameworks, despite being positioned as a companion to a community platform.

## Security
- Without secure storage, any eventual tokens would be at risk if stored ad hoc. There is no biometric/PIN gating for the profile area or settings.
- Network calls are absent, but HTTPS enforcement, certificate pinning, and TLS validation policies are likewise unplanned. Dependencies for secure communication are missing.
- Form inputs do not obfuscate sensitive fields beyond `obscureText` on the password field, and there is no safeguard against shoulder surfing (e.g., toggle visibility, auto-clear on logout).

## Alignment
- The mobile app showcases the same narratives as the web UI (live feeds, program management) but lacks the functionality to back them up. Aligning with the v1.50 goals will require prioritising real authentication, feed consumption, and member management flows.
- There is no offline mode or caching strategy, which conflicts with expectations for a global community app serving users across time zones and connectivity levels.
- Accessibility considerations (screen reader labels, contrast checks) are not addressed, diverging from inclusive design objectives.
