# Pre-Update Issue List – Version 1.00

1. Backend controllers, GraphQL resolvers, schedulers, and realtime namespaces still return mock data or never start connected workers, so payments, moderation, analytics, recommendations, curriculum sync, and retention workflows fail once traffic hits real services.
2. Feature flag defaults, tenancy guards, and environment bootstrap scripts do not seed Redis or the database, leaving critical modules disabled by default, leaking cross-tenant data, and forcing manual toggles for every deployment.
3. Third-party integrations (Stripe, PayPal, AWS S3, CloudConvert, ClamAV, FFmpeg, MeiliSearch, Twilio, LMS connectors) lack sandbox abstractions, retries, circuit breakers, dead-letter queues, and health checks, so outages or missing binaries crash the platform without graceful degradation.
4. Internal SDKs, webhook handlers, and partner callbacks reference deprecated endpoints and undocumented payload shapes, breaking compatibility with frontend, mobile, and partner clients.
5. Knex migrations, seeds, partition jobs, and schema guards are incomplete—tables go unused, referential integrity fails silently, reporting views stay empty, and clean installs miss required enums or partition tables.
6. Sensitive data remains plaintext without encryption, masking, tenancy enforcement, audit trails, retention automation, or tested backup/restore drills, making SOC2, GDPR, COPPA, and FERPA commitments unattainable.
7. Database governance tooling (data catalogues, lineage, consent receipts, synthetic QA datasets) is missing, so schema drift and privacy obligations cannot be audited or verified.
8. Dependency management is fragmented across npm, yarn, Flutter, Terraform, Docker, and binary prerequisites with no Renovate/Dependabot, SBOM, or licence auditing, leaving known CVEs unresolved and installs non-deterministic.
9. Binary toolchains (ClamAV, FFmpeg, MJML, Chromium, Java, native addons) are undocumented, unpinned, and absent from container images, causing `MODULE_NOT_FOUND`, ENOENT, and libc incompatibilities in CI and production.
10. The TypeScript SDK and generated OpenAPI/GraphQL clients drift from backend behaviour because there are no automated regeneration pipelines, contract tests, or published workspace packages.
11. The React operator dashboard depends on mock datasets, disconnected multi-step flows, and inconsistent loading/error states, so operators cannot complete payments, onboarding, analytics, governance, or compliance journeys end-to-end.
12. Web security and accessibility remain weak: tokens live in localStorage, HTML previews are unsanitised, CSP/sandboxing is absent, ARIA/focus management is missing, and WCAG/localisation coverage is incomplete.
13. Internal admin tooling for impersonation, tenant management, support audit trails, and incident triage is stubbed or hidden, preventing customer success teams from resolving issues.
14. The provider mobile app has been retired without a replacement workflow, migration guide, or communications plan, stranding partners who rely on mobile scheduling, compliance capture, payouts, inventory updates, and offline operations.
15. Dormant provider credentials, push topics, IAM roles, secrets, and analytics still exist, generating noise, accruing cost, and exposing security/compliance risk because decommissioning and rotation never happened.
16. The learner Flutter app relies on mock services, disabled isolates, and missing integrations for offline caching, push, chat, QR attendance, calendar sync, adaptive recommendations, and monetisation, so the "mobile companion" experience is non-functional.
17. Learner mobile security and telemetry are absent—tokens persist without refresh or device binding, SSL pinning and jailbreak detection are missing, crash/analytics tooling is disabled, and privacy consent never syncs to the backend.
18. Cross-platform contracts drift unchecked: schema annotations are missing, generated SDKs are stale, clients mix ad-hoc REST calls, and no consumer contract tests or schema diff gates exist.
19. Observability, queue management, and incident tooling are superficial: no dead-letter queues, no PagerDuty/Sentry hooks, no SLO/SLI programme, and health checks ignore downstream providers, leaving teams blind to background failures.
20. Infrastructure-as-code is inconsistent—Terraform modules lack pinned providers and remote state, Docker Compose files hard-code secrets, and CI pipelines skip image scanning, provenance, and automated smoke tests.
21. Environment parity is broken: local/staging/prod diverge in feature flags, seed data, storage buckets, IAM policies, and binary prerequisites, causing configuration drift and invalidating QA results.
22. Automated testing is largely absent—unit tests are skipped, integration fixtures are missing, end-to-end suites are disabled, and no load, accessibility, localisation, or security testing runs in CI.
23. Release management lacks structure: versioning differs per package, builds are unsigned, no dry-run environments exist, rollback playbooks are missing, and incident response relies on ad-hoc Slack coordination without postmortems.
24. Contributor onboarding, API docs, support playbooks, and go-to-market collateral are outdated, referencing deprecated features and missing prerequisites, so teams cannot execute or communicate accurately.
25. Cross-functional alignment is broken—product requirements, design specs, engineering trackers, compliance reviews, and finance forecasts diverge, making stakeholder commitments unreliable.
26. Marketing, sales, investor, and compliance collateral continue to promise realtime collaboration, AI personalisation, provider parity, offline resilience, modular deployment, SOC2 readiness, and governance capabilities that the codebase cannot deliver, creating reputational and contractual risk for Version 1.00.
27. Analytics plumbing is unfinished—event producers omit structure, warehouse pipelines (Airbyte/Fivetran, dbt) never deployed, and BI dashboards reference deprecated schemas, forcing teams to rely on manual spreadsheets and undermining decision quality.
28. AI/ML and experimentation initiatives cannot launch because feature stores, model registries, drift monitoring, and governance guardrails are absent, leaving “AI-powered personalisation” and experimentation roadmaps blocked.
29. Telemetry, observability, and consent management are inconsistent across web, mobile, and backend clients, causing duplicate events, PII leaks, and jurisdictional non-compliance for analytics data.
30. Support tooling (Zendesk, Intercom, impersonation, safe-mode access) is outdated or missing, so frontline teams cannot triage incidents, honour SLAs, or troubleshoot tenant issues without engineering intervention.
31. Knowledge base articles, training curricula, sandbox environments, and enablement decks reference retired features and broken workflows, leaving support, sales, and partner teams without accurate guidance.
32. Finance cannot reconcile revenue because Stripe/PayPal integrations lack ledger balancing, tax handling, refund automation, or reliable settlement webhooks feeding reporting systems.
33. Monetisation mechanics (pricing catalogues, usage metering, marketplace commissions, payouts) are hard-coded or disabled, preventing the organisation from launching promised billing models or forecasting revenue accurately.
34. Contract, vendor, and legal governance is fragmented—no system-of-record tracks commitments, side letters, or third-party risk assessments, so compliance with service credits, privacy clauses, and procurement policies cannot be demonstrated.
35. Enterprise risk management lacks ownership, runbooks, or evidence; there is no risk register, business continuity plan, RTO/RPO mapping, or audit trail to satisfy SOC 2/ISO/GDPR certification requirements.
