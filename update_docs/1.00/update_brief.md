# Version 1.00 Update Brief – Edulure Full Ecosystem Release

## 1. Executive Overview
Version 1.00 converts Edulure into a production-ready learning, commerce, and community operating system that unifies every capability from the Full Functions List across web, backend, and Flutter experiences. The release is organised into seven delivery tasks captured in the [Update Plan](update_plan.md), cross-sequenced through five milestones in the [Milestone Plan](update_milestone_list.md), and governed by the [Task List](update_task_list.md) plus the [Progress Tracker](update_progress_tracker.md). Platform hardening (Task 1) is 10% complete and Cloudflare-driven commerce foundations (Task 2) have started at 5%, establishing the security, storage, and payment primitives required for downstream launches. Communities, explorer search, dashboards, mobile parity, QA, and launch operations will progress once these baselines are ratified by governance reviews.

## 2. Release Objectives
- **Deliver the General Area suite** – Ship live feed aggregation, course and ebook purchasing, Agora-powered live classrooms (free and ticketed), and tutor hourly hire tied to Stripe/PayPal commerce pipelines.
- **Activate Communities 2.0** – Provide community feeds, role management, calendars, maps, subscription paywalls, leaderboards, affiliate monetisation, chat upgrades, location tracking, and moderation across learner and provider interfaces.
- **Modernise dashboards** – Rebuild user and instructor dashboards with profile editing, followers, finance, settings, widgets, statistics, ID verification, community switcher, classroom management, pricing, analytics, and chat inbox experiences.
- **Launch Explorer & Ads intelligence** – Deliver Meilisearch-powered explorer search covering communities, profiles, courses, ebooks, tutors, ads, and policies alongside the Edulure Ads PPC/PPI/PPConversion suite with targeting, budgeting, campaign forecasting, and traffic predictions.
- **Strengthen governance** – Complete policy centre, privacy, notifications, spam/bad word detection, admin/customer service panels, calendars, and Cloudflare R2 storage governance with security controls.
- **Achieve Flutter parity** – Implement learner and provider mobile apps covering communities, courses, ebooks, live classes, tutors, ads, notifications, explorer, and ad management.
- **Guarantee quality** – Execute integration testing across backend, front-end, user phone app, provider phone app, database, API, logic, and design as required by the plan, culminating in an error-free production launch.

## 5. Integration Strategy
- **Backend:** Expand Express services with modular domains for storage, commerce, communities, search, notifications, and analytics while enforcing rate limits, authentication guards, and logging.
- **Front-end (React):** Introduce shared API client, state management, responsive layouts, accessibility, and error boundaries for live feeds, commerce funnels, community management, explorer, ads dashboards, and admin panels.
- **User Phone App (Flutter Learner):** Adopt dio + Riverpod/Bloc architecture, offline caching, secure storage, and parity modules for communities, courses, ebooks, live classrooms, chat, explorer, notifications, and ads.
- **Provider Phone App:** Mirror instructor dashboard, community management, pricing, analytics, chat inbox, and ad management with secure workflows and offline resilience.
- **Database:** Extend schemas for assets, courses, ebooks, progress tracking, quizzes/exams, communities, roles, chat, paywalls, ads, notifications, finance, policies, and telemetry with migrations and rollback drills.
- **API:** Publish OpenAPI/GraphQL specs covering storage, commerce, community, explorer, ads, notifications, policies, admin, and support operations; include pagination, filtering, and error standards.
- **Logic & Automation:** Implement PPT/ebook conversion workers, drip content schedulers, tutor availability, recommendation engines, ranking algorithms, spam filters, notification dispatchers, and analytics collectors.
- **Design:** Finalise design tokens, component libraries, accessibility standards, localisation guidance, and annotated specs for every surface (web + mobile) as captured in Tasks 5, 6, 8, and 9 of the plan.

## 6. Testing & Quality Coverage
- Follow the integration testing requirements embedded in each task: backend unit/integration/load/security, React regression/accessibility, Flutter device matrix, provider app UAT, database migration rehearsals, API contract tests, logic workflow verification, and design QA reviews.
- Implement automation pipelines per Task 7, ensuring continuous validation for live feed, commerce, community, explorer, ads, chat, notifications, policies, and calendar functionality.
- Schedule milestone-specific test suites: Milestone 2 focuses on commerce and learning flows; Milestone 3 adds community/social/regulation tests; Milestone 4 validates search/ads ranking accuracy; Milestone 5 delivers full-system regression, beta cohorts, and store compliance.

## 7. Risks & Mitigations
- **Dependency Drift:** Mitigated by Task 1 dependency governance and CI audits; blockers escalated in milestone reviews.
- **Compliance & Payments:** Stripe/PayPal paywalls, tutor payouts, and affiliate campaigns require legal/finance sign-off; integrate approval checkpoints before Milestone 3 exits.
- **Search & Ads Accuracy:** Meilisearch relevance and ad targeting depend on analytics quality; configure monitoring and anomaly alerts in Task 4.5.
- **Mobile Store Timelines:** Store submission lead times could impact launch; Task 6.5 mandates early asset preparation and phased rollout plans.
- **Design/Engineering Misalignment:** Task 5 and Task 8 coordination prevents duplicate component work; host joint reviews and maintain token governance logs.
- **Quality Debt:** Progress tracker highlights remaining gaps; no milestone closes until all six metrics reach 80%+, with launch gated at 100%.

## 8. Immediate Next Actions
1. Finalise Task 1 observability dashboards and feature flag services so Task 2/3 squads can consume them.
2. Complete Cloudflare R2 provisioning playbook and Agora integration proofs for live classrooms.
3. Kick off community schema design workshops covering roles, paywalls, affiliate earnings, and moderation per Task 3.
4. Draft Meilisearch infrastructure plan, including security keys, replication, and ETL sequencing for Task 4.
5. Align dashboard/profile requirements with design tokens and analytics to unblock Task 5 build.
6. Prepare Flutter architecture RFC covering dio, Riverpod/Bloc, secure storage, and feature flag integration for Task 6.
7. Stand up QA automation roadmap (Task 7) tying regression suites to milestone exits and progress tracker metrics.

## 9. Launch Readiness Criteria
Version 1.00 will be cleared for release when:
- Every task reports 100% across security, completion, integration, functionality, error-free, and production metrics in the progress tracker.
- Cloudflare R2, commerce, community, explorer, ads, and dashboard capabilities pass end-to-end tests on web and both Flutter apps.
- Policies, notifications, spam controls, admin/customer service panels, and calendars are operational with documented SOPs.
- App Store and Play Store submissions (learner + provider) are approved, with monitoring, crash analytics, and on-call rotations active.
- The changelog, knowledge base, update brief, and end-of-update report are finalised, and rollout war room staffing is confirmed.

This brief is the authoritative reference for steering committee reviews and cross-functional execution of the Version 1.00 programme.
