# Version 1.00 Update Brief

## Executive Overview
Version 1.00 cements Edulure as a production-ready learning, commerce, and community platform that spans web and Flutter clients. The release blends a hardened infrastructure core with high-impact feature pillars: Cloudflare R2 powered content delivery, a deep social graph with modular profiles, Communities 2.0 monetisation, a Meilisearch explorer, rigorous release management, and full mobile parity. Current delivery sequencing keeps every workstream gated behind the foundational upgrades captured in Task 1 and aligns execution with the milestone roadmap through Week 18. Outside of documentation groundwork in Task 6, development workstreams remain in planning or backlog refinement; this brief defines how the cross-functional teams will activate, validate, and launch the update.

## Objectives & Success Criteria
- **Platform Integrity:** Finish Task 1 subtasks 1.1–1.5 to lock configuration validation, shared API contracts, dependency governance, database migrations, and orchestration layers that unblock downstream teams.
- **Content Excellence:** Execute Task 2 to migrate assets to Cloudflare R2, deliver PowerPoint and ebook pipelines, and achieve analytics-compliant viewers on web and mobile clients.
- **Social & Community Growth:** Complete Tasks 3 and 4 to introduce the follow graph, profile component system, Communities 2.0 experiences, chat upgrades, and affiliate monetisation across user/provider applications.
- **Discovery & Release Confidence:** Deliver Task 5’s Meilisearch explorer alongside Task 6 QA, documentation, and release management so production reliability and knowledge transfer meet Version 1.00 exit criteria.
- **Mobile Readiness:** Use Task 7 to close feature parity, performance, offline, and store compliance gaps so the Flutter learner and provider apps ship in lockstep with web.
- **Design Alignment:** Progress Task 8 to freeze cross-platform tokens, publish annotated specs, and package design QA artefacts that ensure engineering receives production-ready UI guidance.

## Milestone Alignment & Schedule
- **Milestone 1 – Platform Foundations Locked (Week 4, Complete):** Confirms Task 1 exit criteria covering security validation, OpenAPI contracts, dependency governance, migration rehearsals, and orchestration scaffolding.
- **Milestone 2 – Cloud-Native Content Delivery (Week 8, Complete):** Validates Task 2 content pipelines, cross-platform viewers, offline support, and analytics dashboards.
- **Milestone 3 – Social Graph & Profile System (Week 10, Pending):** Dependent on Milestones 1–2 assets; exits when social schemas, feeds, components, and analytics are live with usability and accessibility sign-off.
- **Milestone 4 – Communities 2.0 & Monetisation Launch (Week 13, Pending):** Relies on social data and design tokens to ship community modules, chat upgrades, monetisation flows, and accessibility/localisation audits.
- **Milestone 5 – Explorer & Release Readiness (Week 16, Pending):** Bundles Task 5 delivery with Task 6 QA/readiness artefacts, ensuring Meilisearch, ingestion pipelines, explorer UX, and release documentation are production-ready.

## Progress Snapshot (from Progress Tracker)
- **Completed:** All Task 1 and Task 2 subtasks (100% across security, completion, integration, functionality, error-free, production).
- **In Progress:** Task 6 overall at 3% due to testing plan baseline; Task 8 averaging 36% with subtasks ranging 23–42% overall.
- **Not Started:** Tasks 3, 4, 5, and 7 remain at 0% across all metrics pending activation after readiness reviews.
- **Quality Metrics:** Content pipeline subtasks (2.1–2.5) hold 95% "Error Free" scores due to outstanding CloudConvert credential provisioning; remediation tracked as part of production readiness.

## Testing & Quality Strategy
- Adopt the published Version 1.10 testing plan as the QA charter for regression, contract, performance, security, and accessibility coverage.
- Execute Task 6.1 suites in CI/CD, including backend contract tests, frontend regression/visual tests, and Flutter device farm runs.
- Run staged beta programmes (Task 6.2) with telemetry dashboards, surveys, and defect SLAs.
- Maintain documentation, release notes, runbooks, and training assets (Task 6.3–6.5) to support enablement and post-launch operations.
- Extend Task 7.4 mobile QA to cover offline/online transitions, crash analytics, and assistive technology validation before store submissions.

## Dependencies & Risk Management
- Downstream tasks (2–7) cannot start without Task 1 gate approvals on security, API contracts, and migration frameworks; enforce readiness reviews before handoff.
- Coordinate shared data contracts, analytics schemas, and design tokens between Tasks 2–5 and Task 8 to prevent rework and ensure UI consistency.
- Manage monetisation and mobile launch risk via feature flags, rollback scripts, phased rollout plans, and financial compliance reviews.
- Track CloudConvert credential provisioning (Task 2 error-free delta) and ensure staging parity before additional content ingestion.
- Maintain a central risk register updated weekly with mitigation owners, contingency plans, and escalation triggers aligned to milestone checkpoints.

## Next Steps & Action Items
1. **Readiness Reviews:** Schedule cross-team reviews to confirm Task 1 artefacts are consumed by frontend/mobile squads and to greenlight Task 3 development.
2. **Social Graph Kick-off:** Finalise schema designs, moderation workflows, and caching strategies; prepare migration scripts and privacy impact assessments.
3. **Community & Monetisation Prep:** Align payment gateway integration tasks with finance/compliance, and draft affiliate payout runbooks ahead of implementation.
4. **Explorer Foundations:** Provision Meilisearch environments, define ingestion data contracts, and outline ranking experiment KPIs in collaboration with analytics.
5. **QA Infrastructure:** Expand automated test scaffolding, connect telemetry dashboards, and integrate beta feedback loops into the defect backlog.
6. **Mobile Parity Planning:** Compile gap analyses for Flutter learner/provider apps, map required API enhancements, and outline store asset production schedule.
7. **Design Handoff:** Continue Task 8 momentum by locking tokens, delivering annotated specs, and booking engineering/design QA walkthroughs.
