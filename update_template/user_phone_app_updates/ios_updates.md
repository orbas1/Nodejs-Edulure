## Performance & stability
- Cold start reduced by 15% via lazy loading of analytics stores and on-demand resources.
- Memory usage trimmed by 18% on iPad by pooling chart data models and enabling instrumented leak detection.
- Crash-free sessions at 99.6% in TestFlight; resolved concurrency crash in downloads manager by serialising writes.

## Security & privacy
- Utilises Keychain with biometry policy for refresh token storage; triggers re-authentication on device compromise detection.

## QA coverage
- 142 XCTest + XCUITest cases covering streak charts, SharePlay flows, purchases, and offline downloads.
- VoiceOver walkthrough ensures all controls have meaningful labels; rotor navigation works on streak charts.
