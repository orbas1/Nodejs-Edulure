# User Application Styling Changes

## Design System Alignment
- Adopted **Aurora** token set to harmonize typography, spacing, and elevation with web counterpart.
- Updated base font to `Inter` with dynamic type scaling that respects OS accessibility preferences.
- Established 8px baseline grid with responsive multipliers for tablet breakpoints.

## Color & Theming
- Introduced adaptive theming engine with light/dark palettes; tokens automatically invert for high-contrast mode.
- Primary accent color shifted to `#5C6BFF` (Indigo Pulse) to improve contrast ratios; verified AA compliance for text on backgrounds.
- Added semantic status colors: success `#2CC990`, warning `#FFB347`, danger `#FF5C5C`, info `#3AA9FF`.

## Component Updates
- **App Bar:** Reduced height to 56dp, added subtle bottom shadow, and integrated breadcrumb indicator.
- **Cards:** Rounded corners increased to 16dp, with soft gradient backgrounds for featured content.
- **Buttons:** Elevated buttons now use uniform 4dp shadow; disabled state uses 40% opacity with dashed border for clarity.
- **Form Inputs:** Expanded touch area, added animated floating labels, and accessible error text with iconography.

## Imagery & Iconography
- Migrated to outline icon set for clarity; used consistent stroke weight (1.5px).
- Onboarding illustrations refreshed with inclusive, diverse representation and exported in vector format for crispness.
- Added fallback icons for network errors and offline states using `Feather` library.

## Motion & Feedback
- Applied 200ms ease-in-out transitions to primary navigation changes.
- Introduced micro-interactions for success toasts (scale + fade) and error states (vibrate on mobile devices supporting haptics).
- Loading skeletons replaced spinner components to reduce perceived wait time.

## Accessibility Considerations
- Ensured text/background contrast ratios â‰¥ 4.5:1 for body content and 3:1 for large headers.
- Provided focus outlines with 2px offset using accessible blue highlight (#2563EB).
- Added `aria-live` regions for toast notifications to announce status changes for assistive technologies.
