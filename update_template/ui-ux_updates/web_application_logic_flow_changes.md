# Web Application Logic Flow Changes

## Authentication & RBAC
- Enforced step-up authentication for actions tagged `requires_verification` (e.g., payout configuration, compliance exports).
- Session refresh now uses silent token renewal with 5-minute grace period; on failure, user redirected to login with preserved context.
- RBAC middleware surfaces contextual messaging when users attempt restricted actions, offering request-access workflow.

## Dashboard Experience
1. User lands on dashboard → system fetches aggregated metrics (progress, revenue, engagement) in parallel.
2. Data normalization layer ensures consistent currency and timezone formatting before rendering widgets.
3. Alerts queue prioritized by severity; dismissed alerts logged to telemetry to prevent re-surfacing within 30 days.

## Course Publishing Workflow
1. Creator drafts module → auto-save every 15 seconds with conflict resolution prompts when collaborative editing detected.
2. Publishing wizard validates prerequisites: content completeness, compliance checklist, pricing rules.
3. Upon publish, background job notifies subscribers, triggers search index re-sync, and updates analytics counters.

## Community Moderation Flow
- Curators receive flagged content feed with severity score from ML moderation service.
- Accept/Reject actions now include mandatory reasoning captured for audit logs.
- Escalations to administrators auto-create tickets with evidence attachments stored in secure bucket.

## Analytics & Reporting
- Introduced incremental data loading with virtualization to handle large datasets.
- Filter state persisted via URL parameters enabling sharable views without exposing sensitive identifiers.
- Export requests queued and processed asynchronously; status indicators update in UI via websocket channel.

## Settings & Integrations
- API key creation requires multi-factor confirmation; keys scoped to RBAC roles and environment (staging/production).
- CORS configuration UI validates domain format client-side and server-side, blocking wildcards by default.
- Webhooks now support pause/resume toggles with automated retries on 429/5xx responses.

## Error Handling & Observability
- Unified error boundary wraps core routes, presenting human-readable explanations with support links.
- 403 and 404 states now log to security analytics pipeline with correlation IDs displayed to user.
- Client-side logging sanitized to prevent PII leakage; structured logs forwarded only after user consent.
