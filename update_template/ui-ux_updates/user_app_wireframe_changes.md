# User App Wireframe Changes

## Global Navigation
- Replaced legacy top bar with hybrid sidebar + contextual header wireframe, optimizing space on desktop while keeping mobile tabs intuitive.
- Added quick action shortcuts (profile, notifications, help) anchored to top-right for consistent access.

## Dashboard Wireframe
- Hero section divided into three stacked cards: onboarding checklist, upcoming engagements, and personalized insights.
- Secondary grid showcases announcements, recommended courses, and progress analytics with equal visual weight.
- Notification stream positioned on right column for large screens and collapses into modal for mobile.

## Profile Wireframe
- Multi-step wizard delineated into Overview, Security, Preferences, and Privacy segments with persistent progress tracker.
- Inline contextual help slots added beneath complex fields with icon triggers.
- Confirmation screen wireframe includes summary, downloadable receipts, and follow-up suggestions.

## Serviceman Mobile Wireframe
- Single-column layout with sticky header showing next job and status toggle.
- Route map preview occupies upper half, while job checklist and communication buttons fill lower half.
- Offline banner wireframe spans full width with reconnection guidance and manual sync control.

## Provider Dashboard Wireframe
- Split layout: left column for schedule calendar, right column for lead pipeline and revenue summary.
- Action drawer slides from right to manage bookings, invoices, and notes without leaving the current view.
- Bottom bar wireframe includes quick metrics for SLA compliance, satisfaction scores, and outstanding tasks.

## Accessibility Considerations
- Minimum 16px body text, 20px+ for headline sections.
- Defined focus order explicitly in wireframes to guide engineering implementation.
- Specified safe zones for gesture controls to avoid overlap with OS indicators on mobile.
