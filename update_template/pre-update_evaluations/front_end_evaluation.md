# Front-End Evaluation

## Code Quality
- ESLint, Stylelint, and TypeScript checks integrated into CI; zero outstanding lint violations.
- Storybook stories updated for every new component with accessibility documentation and controls.
- Cypress visual diffs confirm layout stability on primary viewports.

## Performance
- Lighthouse scores: Dashboard (Desktop 95/Mobile 92), Profile (Desktop 96/Mobile 93), Dispatch (Desktop 94/Mobile 91).
- Core Web Vitals monitored via Web Vitals library: LCP 1.8s p75, FID 30ms p75, CLS 0.04 p75.
- Code splitting ensures initial bundle < 200KB gzipped; async modules lazy-loaded on demand.

## Accessibility
- WCAG 2.2 AA compliance validated via manual audit and axe automated scans.
- Focus management, ARIA labels, and semantic landmarks implemented across wizards and dashboards.
- Color palette updated to maintain contrast while honoring brand guidelines.

## Security
- CORS rules enforce `https://*.tenant.edulure.com` allowlist with credentials restricted to same-site cookies.
- Content Security Policy updated to limit script sources and enable `upgrade-insecure-requests`.
- Session manager handles token refresh, automatic logout on inactivity, and revocation upon suspicious login attempts.

## UX Research
- Conducted moderated usability sessions with 12 participants across roles; SUS score improved from 72 to 86.
- Beta feedback loop captured in Productboard; 18 issues resolved, 2 deferred to next iteration.
- Analytics instrumentation validated to track adoption of new features.

## Testing
- Vitest suite: 428 specs passing with 86% statement coverage (goal met).
- Playwright: 64 integration scenarios executed nightly with flaky test budget < 1%.
- Contract tests (Pact) verifying data contracts with backend analytics and consent services.
