# Backend Evaluation

## Architecture Review
- Backend `v3` services expose necessary endpoints for analytics, scheduling, consent, and profile management.
- RBAC matrix validated to ensure new dashboard widgets map to existing scopes (`admin:read:analytics`, `provider:write:schedule`, `serviceman:acknowledge:dispatch`).
- Telemetry pipelines (Kafka topics `auditTrail`, `dispatchEvents`) scaled to handle projected 30% increase in event volume.

## Reliability
- Load testing via k6 sustained 5k RPS with < 220ms p95 latency on analytics endpoints.
- Circuit breakers configured on service-to-service calls, preventing cascading failures during dependency outages.
- Rate limiting per tenant confirmed to align with updated front-end polling intervals.

## Security
- JWT access tokens shortened to 15 minutes with refresh tokens bound to device fingerprint.
- CORS policy restricted to tenant-specific subdomains; preflight caching optimized for new endpoints.
- Webhooks for CRM integrations signed with rotating HMAC secrets stored in HashiCorp Vault.

## Data Integrity
- Database migrations align with new profile fields (consent ledger, experience timeline).
- Backfill scripts verified in staging to avoid null reference issues for legacy providers.
- Analytical summaries derived from materialized views refreshed every 5 minutes.

## Dependencies
- Node.js runtime on backend services upgraded to 20.11 LTS with no breaking changes observed.
- Prisma and Knex migrations validated; no outstanding deprecations impacting release scope.

## Risks & Actions
- Monitoring coverage extended with Prometheus alerts for `analytics_summary_latency` and `dispatch_queue_depth`.
- Pending: finalize blue/green deployment runbook update before GA (tracked in OPS-2198).
