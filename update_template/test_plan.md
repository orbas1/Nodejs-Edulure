## Scope
Covers web frontend (React) experiences for admins, providers, servicemen, and learners, including dashboards, profile management, scheduling, consent, and security features.

## Objectives
- Validate functional correctness of new role-based workflows.
- Ensure performance budgets and accessibility standards are met.
- Confirm security controls (RBAC, CORS, MFA, session management) operate as designed.
- Provide confidence for production rollout with rollback readiness.

## Test Environment
- Staging environment mirrored to production with feature flags enabled.
- Browsers: Chrome 120, Firefox 119, Safari 17, Edge 120.
- Devices: MacBook Pro 16", Surface Laptop 5, iPad Air, iPhone 14, Pixel 7, Zebra TC57 (rugged).

## Test Types & Ownership
| Test Type | Description | Owner | Tools |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Unit Tests | Component logic, hooks, utils | Frontend Dev Team | Vitest, React Testing Library |
| Integration | End-to-end flows incl. API mocks | QA Automation | Playwright, MSW |
| Accessibility | Automated + manual audit | Accessibility Guild | axe, NVDA, VoiceOver |
| Performance | Lighthouse & WebPageTest baselines | Performance Eng | Lighthouse CI, WebPageTest |
| Security | Session, RBAC, CSP validation | AppSec | ZAP Baseline, Burp Suite |

## Entry Criteria
- All code merged to release branch with CI green (lint, test, build).
- Feature flags configured for staged rollout.
- Test data seeded for tenants: `AcademyOne`, `ServicePro`, `CityWorks`.

## Exit Criteria
- 100% test case execution with no critical or high severity defects open.
- Performance budgets satisfied (LCP < 2.5s, TTI < 3.5s mobile).
- Accessibility compliance verified (WCAG 2.2 AA).
- Security testing completed with zero outstanding high/critical findings.
- Rollback procedure validated in staging.

## Test Schedule
- Unit & integration automation: 2024-11-01 to 2024-11-05.
- Manual accessibility & UAT: 2024-11-06 to 2024-11-08.
- Performance & security testing: 2024-11-06 to 2024-11-09.
- Final regression & sign-off: 2024-11-10.

## Test Cases Overview
- **Admins:** Analytics navigation, bulk actions wizard, impersonation flows, incident queue triage.
- **Providers:** Scheduling drag-and-drop, revenue exports, CRM sync, compliance reminders.
- **Servicemen:** Offline job updates, safety acknowledgments, push notification handling, route guidance.
- **Learners:** Profile onboarding, MFA setup, consent toggles, course enrollment.

## Automation Strategy
- Continuous integration triggers Vitest and Playwright suites per commit.
- Nightly scheduled Playwright run with video artifacts and trace uploads.
- Contract tests executed against backend mock server to guarantee schema compliance.

## Risk Mitigation
- Flaky test quarantine policy with 24h turnaround.
- Canary release plan monitors telemetry before 100% rollout.
- Observability dashboards provide live metrics for response time and error rates.

## Reporting
- Daily status updates in #release-war-room Slack channel.
- TestRail dashboards for execution progress; defects tracked in Jira.
- Final summary report shared at go/no-go meeting.
