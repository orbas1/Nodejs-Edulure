# Third-Party Provider Updates

## Payment Providers
- Upgraded Stripe SDK to 13.x with automatic network retries and idempotency key enforcement. Webhook signatures validated with rotating secrets stored in Vault.
- Added payout reconciliation job to cross-check Stripe balances with internal ledger; discrepancies trigger PagerDuty alerts.

## Communication Providers
- Switched transactional email from SendGrid v2 to v3 API with per-tenant branding metadata. Ensured unsubscribe handling remains compliant.
- Integrated Twilio Verify for MFA flows; rate limits configured to prevent SMS abuse. Added fallback voice call option for accessibility.

## Analytics & Telemetry
- Renewed Segment destinations ensuring PII filters match new privacy policy. Added data contract tests verifying event schema stability.
- Updated Sentry DSN and release tagging automation so error tracking matches Git commit SHAs.

## Storage & Media
- Adopted AWS S3 dual-region replication for critical assets. Documented bucket policies and lifecycle rules for cold storage.
- CloudFront signed URLs now include short-lived tokens to prevent hot-linking of premium content.

## Validation
- ✅ Provider sandbox smoke tests executed (Stripe payments, Twilio OTP, SendGrid email, Segment analytics).
- ✅ All provider credentials rotated and stored in Vault with audit logging enabled.
