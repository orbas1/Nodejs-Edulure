# API Integration Changes

## Third-party Integrations
- No additional third-party APIs were onboarded.
- Existing payment, messaging, and analytics integrations continue to use their established SDK versions and authentication keys.

## Internal Service Interactions
- Release readiness automation now emits markdown summaries alongside JSON artefacts, enabling incident response tooling to ingest richer context.
- License reporting and npm audit scripts persist per-workspace outputs that downstream governance dashboards consume without schema adjustments.

## Action Items
- Share regenerated security artefacts with vendor risk teams to keep quarterly compliance reviews current.
