# Webhook Updates

## Stripe Payments
- Verified raw-body middleware remains in place for signature validation. Implemented automatic replay handling for transient errors.
- Added dashboard alerts when webhook delivery latency exceeds 5 minutes.

## Partner Integrations
- Introduced webhook versioning (`v2024-08-01`) with schema documentation and upgrade guides.
- Added fine-grained event subscriptions, allowing partners to select only relevant events.

## Security
- Enforced IP allow-lists for incoming webhooks and rate limits to defend against abuse.
- Secrets rotated via Vault with audit logging and rotation schedule documented.

## Testing
- ✅ Replay tests confirm idempotency handling across payment and enrollment events.
- ✅ Contract tests validate JSON schemas and signature checks for all webhook types.
