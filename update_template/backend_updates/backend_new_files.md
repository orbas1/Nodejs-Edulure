# Backend New Files

- `sdk-typescript/src/generated/.manifest.json` â€“ Generated alongside the TypeScript SDK to record the OpenAPI hash, version, generator metadata, and enumerated service/model coverage for release auditors.
- No other backend files were introduced. All enhancements were implemented within existing Terraform modules, automation scripts, and governance artefacts.
