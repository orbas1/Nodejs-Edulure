# Provider Dashboard Changes

## Business KPIs
- Added real-time revenue tiles segmented by service category, with drill-through to payout schedule and invoice export.
- Introduced lead pipeline funnel with conversion percentages and automated follow-up reminders synced to CRM integrations.
- Embedded retention cohort charts using `@visx/annotation` for highlight callouts.

## Operations Workflow
- Scheduling board now supports drag-and-drop reassignments with conflict detection backed by server-side validation.
- Integrated travel optimization suggestions using Google Distance Matrix API with cached responses to stay within quota.
- Added automated reminders for expiring certifications and compliance documents.

## Collaboration Tools
- Provider teams now have role-based access to shared notes, attachments, and escalations.
- Chat sidebar surfaces learner conversations with sentiment badges and escalation shortcuts.
- Task checklist component enforces completion before closing a service ticket.

## Security & Permissions
