# Flutter App Completion Status

The Flutter segments of the Edulure mobile app still require extensive implementation work to meet the production requirements that were outlined:

- Main feed interactions need real backend connectivity, realtime refresh, and moderation tooling.
- Explorer/search lacks fully wired CRUD flows for resources and tagging.
- Communities, the community switcher, and profile screens need persistent data models, validation, and storage integrations.
- Screenshots and device testing cannot be produced from this environment because the Flutter SDK and emulators are unavailable in the repository workspace.

## Suggested Next Steps

1. Set up a local Flutter development environment with the required SDK and platform tooling.
2. Connect the Riverpod controllers to real API endpoints or local storage mechanisms.
3. Implement comprehensive form validation, accessibility checks, and offline support for each CRUD flow.
4. Capture design-accurate screenshots once the UI can be run on a device or emulator.

These notes document the current gaps so future contributors understand why the requested deliverables could not be satisfied within this environment.
