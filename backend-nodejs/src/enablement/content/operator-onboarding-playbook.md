# Operator Onboarding Playbook

## Purpose
The operator onboarding playbook accelerates the time it takes for a new regional administrator to operate the Edulure platform without engineering support. It packages the hardened backend services, dashboards, and monetisation controls completed in the Version 1.00 remediation programme into a repeatable three-day orientation. Every activity listed below has been validated with our beta pilot tenants, incorporates accessibility guidance, and includes measurable success criteria.

## Schedule overview
### Day 1 – Environment readiness and access provisioning
1. **Identity validation** – Confirm that SSO connections are scoped to the operator tenant and that mandatory security posture checks (MFA, hardware keys for finance approvers) are satisfied.
2. **Console familiarisation** – Provide a guided tour of the Executive Overview, Revenue & Finance, and Support dashboards with focus on feature flag manifests generated by the runtime configuration service. Facilitators should highlight the automated health probes surfaced via `/observability/slos` so operators know when to escalate to infrastructure teams.
3. **Data access controls** – Walk through the RBAC matrix, confirm export permissions for monetisation schedules, and demonstrate audit log trails exposed by the compliance APIs.

### Day 2 – Operational workflows and telemetry
1. **Incident response rehearsal** – Use the platform health widgets and alert timelines to simulate a degraded telemetry pipeline. Administrators practice invoking the telemetry warehouse export API and document mitigating actions in the incident template.
2. **Revenue reconciliation drill** – Run through the refund-aware reconciliation job in a staging tenant. Operators confirm that ledger adjustments, deferred balance updates, and Prometheus counters align with finance policies before signing off.
3. **Consent governance** – Review the consent ledger UI, rehearse revoking a learner consent, and ensure the downstream warehouse freshness monitors recover as expected.

### Day 3 – Communications and enablement
1. **Support tooling** – Cover triage flows in the communications hub, focusing on structured hand-offs to provider support squads. The walkthrough includes the templated macros shipped with the knowledge base integration.
2. **Stakeholder reporting** – Demonstrate how to export BI scorecards and annotate executive dashboards with contextual notes for weekly business reviews. Highlight integrations with the experimentation lab for data-driven decision making.
3. **Success criteria review** – Validate that the operator can complete key tasks: approving a payout, pausing a telemetry source, and publishing a cross-tenant announcement. Capture any blockers in the enablement feedback log.

## Checklists and artefacts
- **Provisioning checklist** – Stored in the governance hub shared drive with automated reminders triggered by the environment parity checks. Must be reviewed and signed within 24 hours of Day 1 completion.
- **Orientation deck** – Contains architecture diagrams for the monetisation finance service, telemetry warehouse flow, and operator dashboards. Updated monthly and linked directly from this knowledge base entry so facilitators always present the latest information.
- **Escalation matrix** – Maintained in the support tooling workspace with named on-call rotations across infrastructure, data, and product operations.

## Metrics and feedback loops
- **Certification survey** – Issued at the end of Day 3; operators must achieve ≥4.5/5 satisfaction across clarity, tooling readiness, and confidence metrics.
- **Time to first independent escalation** – Target under 72 hours. Track through the incident response system and reconcile with operator feedback.
- **Enablement backlog** – Capture improvement requests in Jira under the Enablement epic, tagged with `onboarding` to ensure quarterly retrospectives feed into documentation updates.

## Maintenance ownership
The Customer Enablement team owns updates, with quarterly reviews involving representatives from infrastructure, analytics, and finance. When new backend capabilities ship (for example, updated reconciliation logic or telemetry consent requirements), the owner must update this playbook within five business days. The enablement content API exposes change timestamps so downstream portals and LMS integrations automatically surface the latest revision.

## API documentation sync
- Operators must bookmark the service registry index at `https://docs.edulure.com/apis/index.json` before day one. During onboarding, facilitators verify the published checksum values for `/payments` and `/runtime-config` specs to confirm everyone is using the latest contracts.
- The security section now mandates bearer tokens for all operator APIs; review the documentation snippets during the access provisioning module and rehearse token refresh workflows with the support engineering liaison.
- Capture any discrepancies between the docs and in-product experiences in the enablement backlog immediately. Include the affected spec URL and checksum so engineering can triage without ambiguity.
