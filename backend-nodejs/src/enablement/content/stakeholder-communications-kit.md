# Stakeholder Communications Kit

## Overview
The communications kit provides reusable assets that ensure operators, customer success managers, and leadership teams deliver consistent messaging about the Version 1.00 remediation outcomes and ongoing Version 1.50 roadmap. It draws on telemetry, monetisation, and governance updates so each communication is backed by measurable data and traceable artefacts.

## Core components
### 1. Messaging templates
- **Release announcement** – Summarises the new telemetry warehouse, monetisation reconciliation, and observability fabric. Includes sections for customer impact, data quality improvements, and support contact points. Template links directly to the enablement content API so portals render the latest metrics inline.
- **Incident update** – Provides a three-stage update pattern (acknowledgement, mitigation, resolution) referencing `/observability/slos` data, monetisation exposure, and customer remediation paths. Requires owners to include variance metrics pulled from the finance ledger adjustments.
- **Roadmap briefing** – Communicates upcoming enablement milestones, emphasising documentation refresh cadence, training cohorts, and governance checkpoints.

### 2. Cadence governance
- **Weekly enablement digest** – Aggregates top knowledge base updates, training completion rates, and open feedback items. Distributed automatically via the communications hub using tags from the enablement API capability matrix endpoint.
- **Monthly executive briefing** – Structured deck that surfaces telemetry health, revenue reconciliation accuracy, and enablement adoption. Includes pre-approved commentary so executives can deliver updates confidently.
- **Quarterly customer webinar** – Outlines agenda, demo flow, and follow-up actions ensuring go-to-market teams deliver a cohesive story aligned with finance and product roadmaps.

### 3. Escalation playbooks
- **Customer escalation** – Defines severity levels, SLA timers, and cross-functional responders. Integrates with the support hub to auto-create tasks and log communications for auditability.
- **Regulatory notification** – Provides compliance-ready templates when telemetry consent or revenue integrity incidents require regulator updates. References the compliance APIs for evidence packaging.
- **Executive bridge** – Offers scripts, data snapshots, and follow-up trackers for leadership war rooms, ensuring actions tie back to monetisation and telemetry KPIs.

## Usage workflow
1. **Select template** – Users access the communications hub, choose a template via the enablement API (filterable by audience, product, or tag), and clone it into the appropriate workspace.
2. **Inject current metrics** – Pull telemetry freshness, revenue variance, and enablement adoption stats from the analytics dashboards. The API surfaces recommended metrics per template to keep messaging grounded in data.
3. **Review & approve** – Run the communication through the governance workflow with compliance and finance approvals recorded in the audit log. The kit includes checklists for each communication type.
4. **Distribute & measure** – Send via the notifications centre, track engagement, and log lessons learned in the enablement backlog. The kit includes a feedback rubric and survey link.

## Maintenance & metrics
- Owners must review templates monthly and after every major incident or release. Updates should reference supporting Jira issues and commit hashes where appropriate.
- Success metrics include average time to publish incident updates (<15 minutes), stakeholder satisfaction (≥4.6/5), and reduction in duplicated communications (target 50% decrease).
- The enablement content API records every template download and generates a usage report for quarterly governance reviews.
